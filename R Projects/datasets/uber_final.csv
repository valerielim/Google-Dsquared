A google online can easily call out disputes about riders having to pay cancellation fees to the next uber driver, who were mercilessly made to collect your debts for you.  FYI, I am not even made aware of of my outstanding balance until I was in the middle of my ride. I paid to the driver, not wanting to make things difficult for him. Upon clarification, Uber explained that they have given me a $6 credit by mistake, hence the outstanding charges. It was by no means my fault and now the charge is sneakily imposed on me. It took me for than a week to use up the credits, and another month before my next uber ride. You made no effort to take back the credits before I used it nor make any attempts to inform me until a notification which was sent in the middle of my ride. It was too late to make any dispute then.   I don't think I ever feel safe to engage your services again. Driver not showing up and we cancel? Driver cancelling on us? Calling a ride by mistake and then cancelling within 5 seconds? Oh be prepared to fork out $6 cancellation charge. At this rate, you are more expensive than any other private transport provider in Singapore.","830297007132805_831231657039340","negative",2017-08-21 08:30:47,2017-08-22 00:30:47,"2017-8-22",0,2,242,0.294117647058824,0,11,3,3,-1,-0.297549264582449,"manual"

You offered a $4 discount on my ride, only to inform me that I have to pay an outstanding balance of $6 after i have embarked on my ride. After enquiring, I'm told that the credit was given to me in error, which resulted in the outstanding balance. Please note that the error is made by you, why should I be paying for it? In the first place I would not have chosen uber if not for the credits given. It felt like I'm being duped to go on the ride. The credit was given to me on 30 June... which i utilised on 1 and 12 July. I did not take any uber rides since then. For such a long period of time, i did not received any msg regarding abt this outstanding balance. It felt as if it was a trap only to inform me of this charge after I choose to start a ride.","829787620517077_830019150493924","negative",2017-08-18 16:54:21,2017-08-19 08:54:21,"2017-8-19",8,6,165,0.75,0,5,2,3,9,0.067198400278578,"manual"

"180","Alle Koh Ow Yong","1.02e+16","Dear Uber.  I was totally in shock when I was wrongfully charged for $24.54 when my fare should be $19.93! I only knew about the excess charge of $4.61 after my trip. From the email correspondences from your goodself, you explained that it's because I've changed my route. I will like to reemphasised that I didn't change my route at all! And you mentioned that it's because your driver actually took a longer route and not taking the suggested routes by Uber. Again, it's no fault of mine. I do not work for Uber and I do not know what's the terms of contract between your goodself and the driver. In your words, if your driver didn't follow the suggested route, why did you impose the additional $4.61 on the rider instead? And how can Uber wrongfully charge me for the additional $4.61 without my consent? Is that the correct business practice that you all should adopt? Do you just charge the rider as you deem fit without obtaining the consent from the rider? In this case, it's absolutely unsafe for us to leave our card details with you as we won't know when we will be charged unnecessarily? Looking back at all the emails you send me, you don't seem to feel that by charging rider without their consent is wrong. All your emails only mentioned you will refund me the balance without acknowledging my query on why you charge me without my consent. You are not a metered taxi. If you set a fare, I agree and you stick to it. That's how it works! It's a contract between yourself and the rider. And if you charge me for the wrong route taken, then in your words, shouldn't I seek compensation from you because your driver took a longer route and that results to my time loss? In your email, you mentioned I have issues with your driver, No! I have no issues with your driver. My ride was otherwise smooth if I wasn't wrongfully charged. So again, do not distort the facts. Please look into how you all should handle customer's payment details safely. Thank you.","826101490885690_828943060601533","negative",2017-08-16 08:12:19,2017-08-17 00:12:19,"2017-8-17",0,4,359,0.181818181818182,0,10,11,0,2,0.144034874935691,"manual"

Would like to ask everyone here, is it not obvious that from the direction the driver is coming from in both examples, isn't the red circled area in closer proximity instead of the blue circled area?  Instead in both cases, the allocated way was for the driver to go to the blue circled area first.  And what's up with the yellow shaded area?  Why have to make one big round to go to that address highlighted by that yellow shaded area?  Yes I took the time to do this because I really hope you can improve, the current system is very disadvantaged towards the Punggol West residents because we are always allocated to drop off last even though very clearly, our address is way closer to the expressway than the other address and the driver is coming in from TPE and not KPE.  I really hope this can be improved in future because it's really unfair to us and the driver (wastes more fuel due to roundabout way trip is allocated).

I was charged toll/surchage fee from airport yesterday and I have PM via app 2 times no one reply me. Another question, I was wrongly double charge a few times although money has been credit back to my bank account but bank charges already incurred. Have PM this issue and was told your end has no control I should refer to bank but if Uber didnt double charge wrongly consumers wont have to incurred unnecessary charges and expecting us to always absorb this charges. Whats your say ? Althought amount is not big but as a regular rider and having double charge and refunds, such issue can be avoidable on your end.

"312","Irene Patricia Yee","1.02e+16","I am lodging a complaint on the unprofessional and threatening behaviour of one of your drivers.   The driver arrived at Ikea pickup point on the second lane, and barely stopped at the uphill slope. I had two heavy Ikea bags and gestured for him to move forward as cars were coming in and it would be difficult to load the bags into the boot. He did not move his car. I waited for a taxi to go past as it was coming up the slope and the taxi driver had impatiently honked at another driver ahead before I crossed over and loaded the boot.   I got into the car without saying a word. The driver asked if I was happy with the service. I replied, 'Not particularly' (along this line). He then asked me to get out of the car and stated he would not drive me to my destination. I assure you if this sounds absurd and unbelievable, it happened exactly as I have described. The driver's car ought to have a video recording; feel free to verify that what I am relating is the absolute truth.  This driver was most determined at provoking me. I told him I would not do as he pleases. He then said he would drive me to the police station. I told him to do what he needed to do. He then drove around the Ikea dropoff point a number of times before calling the police on his mobile phone.   On the phone with the police, he stated that he was on the second lane because Uber drivers are not supposed to pick up at taxi stands. He then added that I was well aware of this. We had zero exchange on this, so it is perplexing that the driver would know what was in my head. It became apparent the driver had to lie to justify his absurd behaviour.  The driver was most selfish to throw this fracas, especially since he had picked up another Uberpool rider and so he was being most unprofessional and inconveniencing two riders at once. Please check with the the other rider if I had said a word upon entering the car. At no point during this incident did I rant, rave or even raise my voice and hurl verbal abuse. The driver is not the owner of me that he should think he can dictate my feelings, thoughts or actions. It is not as if he had greeted me politely and I had not responded. It is not as if he had graciously helped with my bags and I had been ungrateful. Even so, the driver should not feel at liberty to treat riders with so much disdain and disrespect at his fancy, especially when he is representing the Uber brand.  I called ber and connected with Christine and John, a supervisor, who stated there was nothing he could do to assist, while waiting for the police to arrive. It is most absurd that the police had to be called in, when I had done absolutely nothing to provoke the driver. Basically, the driver imagines riders who enter a car quietly ought to be treated badly, humiliated, and terrorised.   Threatening a passenger and asking her to get out of the car as a means to humiliate her when she had said absolutely nothing cannot possibly be acceptable behaviour of Uber drivers or be representative of Uber's standard.  Inspector Lau informed me that it was really unsafe for me to continue with this journey. I agreed. I got another ride, not with Uber.  Uber needs to do the right thing here and take heed of my complaint. This was most unacceptable and absurd service in this day and age. I will state the likes of such drivers will only tarnish the Uber brand. Kindly ensure that this matter receives the attention it deserves.

"330","Benson Lee","1.9e+15","Hello to this UBER driver. If you saw my post. Good earning $ ah. I know I with Kid and my Wife. and was a short trip. We not even using your child seat. And you contact UBER say we use and you charge us a extra $5. Good earning bro.  Nice Uber. Reply this , Sorry to hear about the trouble, Benella.  As you may know, safety is our number one priority and driverpartners are required to follow all applicable regulations in their city. The Singapore government has advised that all children under 1.35m in height should be in an approved child seat. If your driver complies with child restraint regulations, there is no problem taking children in their vehicle.  Your driver contacted us to let us know that you have used his car seat for your ride. Please note that the car seat falls part of our Uber Car Seat product, an ondemand car seat option; the perfect transportation option for parents on the go. All Uber Car Seat vehicles are installed with the IMMI Go Car Seat thats easy to install and safe for kids aged 1 year old and above and weighs between 10 to 25kg. This product incurs a SGD 5 booking fee on top of your UberX fare, which we have added to your trip.  Drivers, however, have no obligation to carry a child seat as they may not always have the appropriate restraints. When requesting trips using Uber, you may want to call or text message the driver before they arrive to ensure they are able to take you and your child. If you have a driver who does not carry the appropriate child seating, you are more than welcome to cancel the trip and will not be charged with cancellation fees.  Please let me know if I can help in any other way. Have a great day ahead!  In the first place the driver didn't even mention that my child needs a car seat when we board his car. So what makes you think that I have to pay when I didn't use this thing? My child was sleeping hand carried by my Husband all the way! Since when did we use the car seat. He can cancel if he doesn't have a car seat and insist we use one. BUT HE DIDNT EVEN MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT THE CAR SEAT  What kind of service is this UBER? Not customer first priority. Is the driver they hired their priority. Hahas. And the driver not even mansion about the childseat at all when we board. Good job UBER and this RAYMOND UBER DRIVER.

"917","Alex Chen","1.02e+16","There were 3 rides that I took, upfront fare was a certain amount. The fare was BEFORE discount, and the discount was supposed to be applied after the ride. I know this because for so many of the rides I have taken, the discount only got applied AFTER the ride. However, on these 3 particular rides, at the end of the rides, the fare became at least $5 to $6 MORE than the original fare I was initially shown.   I then contacted Uber regarding the fare being bloated after the ride  and guess what?? They adjusted the fare down to the original upfront fare, but CLAIMED that the bloated fare WAS the original fare, and hence, I did not get the discounts from the original upfront fare because that was supposed to be the discounted fare. Does that even make sense?? How can a fare be bloated up instead of getting discounted, at the end of a ride??   Morever, I took screenshots from various other rides I took during the same period, as well as noted ALL my evening rides  ALL these rides only had discount applied AFTER the ride! So, is Uber trying to cheat our money by doing this? Out of 20 rides, all upfront fare is original price, then slip 3 rides in and bloat the fare ""by mistake"" after the ride, then CLAIM that that was in fact, the original fare and the original upfront fare was the discounted fare???

I have logged many complains on this issue, yet the problem has not been solved. please do not just mark the case solved until a satisfied solution is provided so that i can reply with follow up rather than logging a new complain all the time.

Now I try to use these codes wisely and at the right time to maximise the benefit of different promos being offered time to time. Just an advice: use your best code first and exhaust it before thinking of applying new code.

"1207","Mervyn Jui Meng Tan","1.14e+15","Dear Uber  You've been changing your promotion code discount application rules for Singapore these past months.  Before (Jan to March), it was last in first out (LIFO) and on Thursday evenings when we received and input the new promotion code sent to us via email, our currently active promotion code (sometimes not fully utilised, eg only used 2/4 eligibility) would cease to work and we'd need to wait till Thursday midnight or Friday 6am to again get to enjoy our new promo code discount. There was also no simultaneous application like now for RIDEMORN and DAYRIDE (only one promotion code can be used at a time). Previously it would be one or the other depending on which we input first. We'd need to exhaust 4 trips (eg. RIDEMORN) with one before the other (DAYRIDE) would kick in.  Then in April, suddenly you got very liberal and changed the rules for Singapore to highest discount applies. We were also allowed to stack different promo code discounts like LiveUp $10 with say a $5 off (nett $15 off on our 10th LiveUp trips. Trips with $0 fares plus promo discounted fares towards the 9 LiveUp trip count. Fares with both the discount value (eg $5 off) were applied first then percentage discount (eg 50%) was applied to the remainder and fare charged; listed as Discount ($5 off) and Promotion (50% off amount). Also we were literally covered for promo code discounts from 126am, 610am and 10am to 12pm. EVERYONE WAS SUPER HAPPY AND CONTENT. Uber usage was very high.  NOW I HEAR THAT THIS WEEK, without ANY WARNING or NOTICE whatsoever, Uber in Singapore had regressed back to LIFO You've caught many Uber riders off guard. How? You've ""kindly"" given selected riders with 4 x $3 off, 2050% off (customised) promotion codes. By accepting them, they're no longer eligible for RIDEMORN, DAYRIDE or NIGHTRIDES. They'll need to use their active promo code or exhaust their eligibility. BACK TO THE STONE AGES again What the heck are you trying to do? Screw with your loyal riders in such a cruel and unscrupulous manner Why mess with a good thing that was working fine to everyone's satisfaction  This week, I've received a large number of complaints from my almost 9,500 FB members (https://www.facebook.com/groups/1013566295436747/) with angry complaints about usage and application of promo code discounts; along with improper LiveUp trip counter (not moving and should be entitled to their $10 off but denied due to insufficient trip count or ""can't be combined with other promos."")  Things are seriously getting screwed up on your end when you're giving your customers surprises and conflicting replies. Please get all your foreign call centres' CSOs on the same page and give us all correct and consistent replies and the same and proper treatment. Their training and replies reflects very badly on Uber as a very disorganised company where ""the left hand doesn't talk to the right hand."" Total confusion and disharmony  Oh yes, with 9,500 members, IT IS VERY EASY to compare all your CSOs inconsistent and wrong replies. Get your act together please and ensure all your call centres are reading from the same rule book, ACTUALLY READ our message PROPERLY and THOROUGHLY, before just sending a ""canned reply"" that isn't even relevant to the issue/query.  Last, please read through your own online published LiveUp T&C (https://help.uber.com/h/afddb3fd59074609b9e743b6aa1aaa54) and SHOW US in A FB POST where it's says $0 trips aren't a trip as in ""take 9 trips) and when trips aren't counted due to use with promotion code discounts. I CHALLENGE YOU to reply my comment in full and don't even dare to ask me to email you as all my issues are a consolidation of all my all my FB group members' complaints. I'm very sure even non members have these same problems and issues.

After waiting for a good 15 minutes, I decided to call the driver. He was audibly angry and he told us that he was waiting under a tree in the middle of the busy road. He eventually came to the pick up point where we boarded the car. He was smelling of beer. What happened next was even more shocking. He shouted at my mother because we had failed to flag his car when he drove past the pick up point. My brother then told him that there wasn't a need to raise his voice. Instead of calming down and being professional, he shouted even louder and told us to ""get the **** out of my (his) car."" I was shocked at his behaviour. My brother told him that we will be making a report and he kept on verbally abusing my brother with profanities. We alighted and closed the doors. The driver then wound the windows down before further abusing my brother with Hokkien swear words. He had even charged us for the ride.  I hope to hear from the person in charge within the next few hours. I demand an apology and some compensation from Uber. This driver should be banned from driving.

Since the FIVEOFF3 is the last code that was entered it will first apply on your trips and once the promotion has been fully consumed, the other promotion will apply as long as its still active. Feel free to reach out if you have further questions.""  Uber, this is your reply which I don't think the way you program the line up of your promo codes makes sense especially when my SCB $10 off for next 15 trips promotion is going to expire soon. By the way, this was never like that for the past weeks. I can select which promo to use as they are tagged to individual cards. Meaning to say if I select my SCB to make payment, the $10 off promo code will be used and I appreciate this more than your new method. Bring the old method back please. This new method is like penalising me for adding new promo code and letting my previous promo code lapse whereby it was meant to be a benefit from the bank.","788802627948910_789242581238248","negative",2017-06-03 01:36:53,2017-06-03 18:36:53,"2017-6-3",18,6,194,1,0,0,6,0,12,0.697908152605831,"manual"

No one in the car really want to know. Anyway, monkey business aside. He continued his ranting till he missed 3 or 4 exits, until i start asking him, did he miss the exit or is the other couple alighting first or? Den he realised he missed it.   The reason why we had to take a private transport was simple. I wasnt feeling well and wanted to get home quick. And know what? He decided to alight the other couple first becos they wanted to. And he being the driver didnt bother to check with us if we were alright with it or not. I was already feeling super unwell, had to bear with his preaching, and now the delayed journey home. He didnt even bother apologising or whatsoever. Still confidently says he'll click on alight the other rider after he alight us. Isnt that breaking uber's policy? He isnt following navigation arranged by uber.   Upon alighting, i vomitted all over myself. This could totally be avoided. If he stops his preaching and rants about his problems.

Changing destination will bring inconvenience to fellow passengers and is irresponsible, even to the driver as well!  Also, changing the route halfway opens a can of worms. There will be problems such as calculation for price and route adjustments especially if there are other users sharing the ride.   I would suggest riders who are unsure of their destination to think twice before using uberPOOL, and to instead consider under professional services from UBER such as UberX. This way we can create a better UBER community and have a better UBER experience :)","782242375271602_782442718584901","positive",2017-05-20 14:46:51,2017-05-21 07:46:51,"2017-5-21",7,0,127,0.625,0,3,5,0,4,0.42038077976996,"manual"

Even though the driver told her that it's unfair for himself and I due to inconvenience, she still insisted that she wants their destination to be changed to the latest one  After much quarrel, the mother and the daughter left no choice but to leave the car and alight at their initial destination.

Driver make a big UTurn back to the same place instead of going straight to jcube. Is this reasonable?? If there's another passenger at Batok, would the system turn back to Batok.

High chances are it would have been the case. 3) Why are u converting the money deducted from my bank account into uber credits for a cancelled trip? This is absurd, my money is now stuck with u guys forcing me to spend on an uber ride. The money should instead be added back into my bank account. This is equivalent to forcing me to pay for a service I never received. 4) In addition, a currency conversion fee of $0.06 was charged by my bank to me due to your mistake. How are you going to rectify that? 5) I messaged you guys through the app only to get an unsatisfactory response that does not at all address my concerns. Not only that, but the person who replied actually marked the problem as solved when it is not.

A while later( 1015mins) i was prompted that my driver had arrived. I was still unable to view the ride. I told my driver the issue, and he cancelled the ride.  When I closed and opened my app, i realised that I had been charged $6.00. After much navigating in the app, i managed to report it under ""no connection with driver"" i was then credited 6uber credits.  I would very much like to be refunded cash on my card, as it is does not make sense to have uber points ""refunded"" to me.

But due to the female driver unfamiliar with the route, she went the longer way instead of the initial route indicated from the GPS. In the end, I was being charged $38.54, $14.03 more than my initial fare due to the rerouting. This has also caused me 20 minutes late for my urgent appointment. The driver did not apologize to me, in fact, I still thanks her for the ride. I did not blame the driver for taking a longer route and a longer time to my destination. But I cannot accept that I was being charged extra for the longer route and delay. I was informed via email for the extra charges only after the payment was charged to my credit card.

"482","Huong Tang","1.02e+16","I had terrible & feel like cheated for my first time uber pool service just now. It's going to be my first and my last time to support uber pool. I just wanted to try Uber pool service today and it is big NO NO going forward. Here are what annoyed me :   a) price is ridiculous expensive, if I take normal uber estimated price is $20, I took uberpool with 3 pick up places and I paid fof $19.06 => it doesnt make any sense at all. I paid for price of almost private car & your driver drove me around Spore like im taking a bus  b) Uber never informs passengers about how many pick up places, who will be dropped first before we accept uberpool => I am surely not stupid enough to accept to pay for such price with too many pick up places & long travel time if I know in advance => uber is cheating customers.  c) The route is set up by Uber is ridiculous unreasonable. Driver picked us up at changi airport with another passenger travel to Hougang. We travelled to Bishan and the driver told us he would drop the passenger at Hougang first. I feel like cheated when Uber driver WITHOUT informed us in advance, pick up other passengers in Hougang area .   Overall, it is cheated customer's money and doesnt respect customers when Uber   a) didnt communicate clearly with customer in advance  for the route & how many pick ups place   b) price is almost indifference comparing with taking grab or private uber car => why do I need to take uber pool and pay for such price ?  I'm going to post my review on my fb's page & also comment on uber spore's fb to share my experience and not encourage my friends to take uberpool service anymore. If Uber doesnt make any change to improve uberpool service or reduce price, that type of service can't last long even Uber runs a lot of campaign to promote this service ","806017426227430_809682119194294","negative",2017-07-10 06:09:16,2017-07-10 23:09:16,"2017-7-10",23,1,344,-0.541666666666667,0,12,9,0,-6,0.0270970619168572,"machine"

"503","Wei Ren Lim","1.02e+16","I would like to highlight my disappointment with my recent Uber experience.  For background, when using Uber promotional codes, the upfront fare reflected on my Uber application has always been without the promotion value applied. On my latest trip applying the SAVEFIVE code, I only realised after seeing the receipt that the upfront fare had already incorporated the discount after applying promotional code (i.e. I paid $5 more than I expected).  I wrote in to Uber support to check on this issue, and had I been told that the upfront fare will always reflect the fare after incorporating the promotional value, that would be the end of the story. Instead, the response given was that sometimes the upfront fare incorporates the promotional value, sometimes it doesnt, but dont worry because the correct fare will be reflected in your receipt (see screenshot). This suspenseful game of Uber promotional code roulette speaks of a lack of transparency on fares and a principled approach on how promotional fares are reflected in the upfront fare. Its like going to a restaurant which offering a promotional discount, but not knowing whether the discount applies until after youve been presented with the bill. All Uber riders, please note for your future trips.  To add salt to an already gaping wound, the drivers driving was erratic and hazardous (straddling between two lanes for more than a few seconds and coming without centimeters of hitting another car) and due to the questionable UberPool pairing algorithm, my journey (which would have taken 25 minutes by public transport and 6 times cheaper) took a grand total of 40 minutes. Had I known that I was paying a premium for inconvenience, dangerous driving and a longer journey, I might have considered keeping my money in my pocket for this trip.","785103378318835_785800111582495","negative",2017-05-27 04:13:45,2017-05-27 21:13:45,"2017-5-27",21,6,299,-0.272727272727273,0,5,4,0,-2,0.0956009360992394,"machine"

"578","Roy Lucius","1.02e+16","Uber, I writing my complaint here because so far, 3 of your customer service officers were unable to provide me a satisfactory answer.   Before I keyed in a $5 PROMO code, I was shown an upfront fare of $12.96. After keying in, the fare remained as $12.96. Naturally I thought that the deduction will be made in the final fare review. This is the consistent practice with other PROMOs I have taken in my previous trips. This is also written in your FAQ website, https://help.uber.com/h/d2d43bbcf4bb4882b8bb4bd8acf03a9d , to quote ""This upfront fare does not include promotions or credits.""  Yet, this was not the case, given that the final fare turned out to be $12.96. The receipt miraculously showed that a discount was already applied, hence the initial fare before discount was $17.96.   I have emailed your customer service and they offered me another explanation, saying that different promotions have different T&C.   How would I as a customer, be able to make an informed choice, if your practices are INCONSISTENT?   Your officers refused to give me a refund of $5, ironically telling me, 'we hope your next uber ride will be smooth'.  There won't a next uber ride if this is the kind of practice you impose on your customers.","779756772186829_779928958836277","negative",2017-05-15 13:24:06,2017-05-16 06:24:06,"2017-5-16",6,2,208,0.25,0,2,2,0,0,0.0564276492686879,"machine"

Another customer service officer called Ems then messaged me about the same incident and made a veiled threat about charging my account. I responded but have yet to hear from you.  On top of that, you have: 1. No service hotline 2. No email contact  And the only way of contacting you (the app) is proving to be a nogo. When will you respond to your passengers' feedback? If only you answered your customers with the same expedience at which you process credit card transactions.

Should they take longer than 2 minutes to enter your car, please use your best judgement as to whether or not to cancel the trip. It is always best to give the riders a call after about a minute of waiting.

One time I got a pool ride with 2 other people, all of us were strangers and going to 3 different places.   Next, got an Uber ride where I got into the car, picked up another person, dropped off the other person then went to picked up another person before dropping me off. Best part is, had to wait for both other passengers as they were late. 2 min rule is bs, maybe wait 5 min can still close one eye but waiting over 15 min in total not to mention detours?? That was a nightmare.   Last one that took the cake, detour to pick up another passenger, the other one cancel, took another detour (to back where I was in the first place) to pick up another passenger.   Uber, please don't sacrifice your quality for the sake of more profits. Initially I preferred Uber pool as it had a better algorithm and didn't send me very much out of the way, maybe 510 min max added to my ride as it was usually only one other destination, now it's 20min?? Not cool.

Since the maximum number of people you can take an Uber with (boarding together as friends) is 6 (i.e. UberXL), the answer should be 6 too! Of course, for fewer number of riders like UberPool, the answer is probably 2.  However, the splitting of fares may fail sometimes as the other riders must accept your invitation for splitting if fare before the trip ends! If they do not accept or do not have a valid payment method, then this will fail and you will still be charged for their share!

So I have to chase after his car with my 2 kids when I see him turn to another side. He already know I have 2 kids with me before e ride as my hub had inform him.N he had ask him if they above 1.35cm n my hub had inform him yes. So when I was on his car, he ask e same qns again so I say yes. But one of my kid is sick and sleeping n I'm carrying her.so I belt up my another kid n he keep say put down put e kid n belt her. Than my girl start crying cos she is sick n sleepy. So I was not happy and say uncle can I jus belt her with me than he continue say put her n belt. So I put her down n belt her up even she was crying. So he drive his car than I say how come your company come with such a strict rule, I going to feedback to e company on this rule.(an angry mum saying) He was already moving e vehicle quite far and suddenly he stop his car and say oh u want complain ah than u go down I don want fetch u. I say I want feedback on this policy not u y u ask me go down? And he say go down go down I don want fetch you.U see y he ask me to go out of his car half way when I say I going to feedback?

It was absolutely amazing  Armin played a full 3 hour set on day 2, with all his hits. Even now  I'm still craving to enter a state of trance with Armin yet again.  However, what stands out to me the most about that live set that day was when he got the whole crowd to be silent. To say their prayers, and to let the victims and their families know that we are with them. The crowd was completely silent for that few minutes, and I will never forget the goosebumps I had during that moment. How amazing and rare it is for 35,000 ravers to stay silent  to come together as one big family and pray for MH370.  I would love to bring Frances Winata, who unfortunately never had the chance to meet Armin before, to attend this festival with me.

That was the same period of time when ""this is what it feels like"" was released. We both love this song because whenever we listen to it, it always reminded us of the epic outdoor forest party in Sweden. We still reminisce about the forest party every now and then because we don't really get a chance to party in the woods in Singapore. This concert will be really memorable because we can get to relive those memories once again in the presence of Armin and his live DJ music! (also somewhat in the ""woods"" again).

Driver's contact number  Uber implemented its numbermasking technology that will ""disguise"" personal numbers so Singapore Uber drivers who call from their mobile devices will not be able to see the customer's mobile number and vice versa.  Instead, they will automatically be routed through an encrypted number.  Drivers and riders will then communicate through ""dummy"" numbers, essentially a forwarding number, designed to block the true caller IDs of both the driver and passenger.","751231428372697_751773901651783","neutral",2017-03-26 02:42:43,2017-03-26 18:42:43,"2017-3-26",18,0,74,0.5,0,2,1,0,-2,-0.0430116263352131,"machine"

Has the policy changed which somehow the passengers aren't informed? Third the waiting time is so much longer! The GPS system also takes passengers on a much longer route than the usual one. I can say this as I've taken Uber for the same route a couple of times.   Uber pls step up your act.","743554262473747_743626885799818","negative",2017-03-11 07:24:47,2017-03-11 23:24:47,"2017-3-11",23,6,106,-2,0,1,0,0,-2,0,"machine"

Hallo Uber, I paid as per the amount requested by the driver and now you turn around to fault me? Not forgetting that your ""professional"" team replying to the email is just repeating the fare is $11.90 and gradually increasing to $11.93 after several round of checking.

"1728","Mervyn Jui Meng Tan","1.14e+15","So, taxi companies want to change to dynamic pricing for app bookings to compete head to head with Uber and Grab eh? It's still unclear if they'll only do it during their non peak (no surcharge applied) periods or 24/7? However it seems for street hails and taxi queues, the taxis will use metered fares. If they follow UG's booking fixed fare models, they could start off with GrabCar Economy and UberX like fixed fare trip bookings. If ambitious, they can even progress to a GrabShare and UberPool fixed trip option.  They could also offer promo codes to gain market share from Uber Ang Grab, kicking off another free for all promo code war. ComfortDelGro recently have already been announcing promo codes regularly and with their deep pockets. Combined with Premier and TransCab, this formidable taxi alliance or cartel combined could possibly outlast both Uber and Grab in a no holds bar price/promo code war. Uber and Grab have already slowed down their promo codes to a crawl and dripping trickle. Can Uber and Grab survive the onslaught of the combined taxi alliance/cartel? They may be even forced to form an unlikely and unholy alliance to fend off the competition from the new taxi juggernaut and be completely steamrolled!  Worst is taxis will have the best competitive advantage or ace in the whole of all. Taxis will be able to pickup adults with children under 1.35m as they have a LTA exemption. Good news for Uber and Grab drivers' headaches with those class of riders, plus these class of riders themselves not having to fear being rejected.  But the added competition for normal rides will become more fierce given the sheer size of the combined ComfortDelGro, Premier and TransCab (for now with HDT and SMRT waiting in the wings). Will Uber and Grab be able to handle the onslaught of the new monolith?  Drivers may defect on masse together with fare sensitive riders who have no brand loyalty. It could be an unexpected windfall for both as well as the taxi alliance with their many empty taxis gathering dust in their parking lot. The only barrier for drivers will be the taxi vocational driving license (TDVL). They were all set to take the PDVL (private) but may rethink TVDL now and need longer to obtain it than a PDVL. Existing taxi drivers who jumped ship to Uber or Grab will be able to transition back more easily. Those taxi drivers who were considering a move would probably stay out for now and have a wait and see perspective.  One thing is for sure. More likely than not it will be the rider who will once again be ""king"" and in the cat bird seat!   Time will tell who drivers will ultimately gravitate to. It's time for Uber and Grab to soon reassess many things like revising their partners' compensation, incentives, possibly personal welfare too like offering medical benefits for a start. They'll need to also reexamine their rider retention with lower fares and capped surges like in the Philippines, a new promo code strategy and ways to add value.   Grab has the obvious edge having diversified into so many other ventures. But how much it'll add to their bottom line, no one knows. Clearly it's up to Uber now to do more planning and strategising as they're clearly at the most disadvantage. Hopefully they will finally be forced to offer a customer service phone hotline, something they've long resisted and riders have been clamouring for.  It is going to be an extremely interesting couple of months to come. With the impending regulatory changes to PHV drivers and companies on top of the looming new form of fare competition, riders will be licking their lips with anticipation of being spoilt for choice and lower fares overall.

I wrote in thinking it would be straightforward since there is no such receipt for that date and time showing that I spent $53 but instead this was the genius reply (picture)  Basically they said that the only charges made to the card in question were from my account  a total lie and easily checked if they went thru my records. I've never entered said card's details and have never been charged through said card till the $53 AND there are no receipts at all for $53 on the date that I was charged.   I am appalled by the shoddy investigations for something that is so straightforward. Shouldn't they be able to check which account (clearly not mine since there are no receipts) used my card and block that account  help my credit card company find them for fraud?

I tried several times to book an Uber this morning and I got the message ""Request Failed"" repeatedly. So, I booked a Grab. A few minutes later, a Grab Car AND Uber showed up. I got into the Grab Car (since my Uber app was still on the booking page, NO driver/match indicated) and the Uber driver started horning at me.... The Grab Car stopped and she starting shouting from her car about how I booked an Uber, so I showed her my app page to prove that it didn't indicate a match and yet she still went on and on about how she can't cancel since it affects her ratings. Even my Grab driver had to jump in and try to calm her down by explaining it's an issue with the app. Eventually, we just drove off. This is the SECOND time this week that I've seen this. The first time, it happened to my fellow passenger in an Uber Pool and our driver raised his voice at him while the passenger was trying to explain the situation calmly (he was late to the pick up point because Uber didn't even notify him that he had a car coming).

They can't make up their mind whether they want to apply the discount before or after the trip. Anyone has similar experiences?","736041359891704_743024332526740","neutral",2017-03-10 01:57:49,2017-03-10 17:57:49,"2017-3-10",17,5,63,1,0,0,1,0,2,0.50395263067897,"machine"
