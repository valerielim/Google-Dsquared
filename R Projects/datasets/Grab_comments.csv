I'm shocked to have the driver asking me for the balance of $1 payment in cash. Obviously he was not aware of Grab Pay or, he was trying to make some extra buck,which I doubt so.  Also, I realised he is no proficient in reading maps on the GPS. It was supposed to be a left turn on upper paya lebar, but he brought me to ubi, claiming that the map wasn't updated on his device. The circuit road junction was there for years!  I'm OK if he says he missed a turn as the night was dark, but these 'other'excuses and asking for payment claiming that I didn't pay him, clearly is something I had to post here.  I appreciate if the team can look into this, as this is one weird experience for me, other than drivers who asked me to cancel trips.",883477498470902_884075848411067,negative

In Malaysia, for grab pay, RM 1 = 10 points (pts) So to get a Silver membership, you need 1000 pts, which means you need to spend RM100. (1000pts) For Gold membership, you need 3000 pts, which means you need to spend RM 300. (3000pts) For Platinum membership, you need 8000 pts, which means you need to spend RM800. (8000 pts)   So let’s talk about Singapore’s grab pay.   In Singapore, for grab pay, SGD1 = 16pts  So to get a Silver membership, you need 3000 pts, which means you need to spend SGD187.50. (3000pts) For Gold membership, you need 9000 pts, which means you need to spend SGD562.50. (9000pts) For Platinum membership, you need 19000 pts, which means you need to spend SGD1187.50. (19000 pts)   I would have easily gotten platinum membership if I am in Malaysia. Sadly, I am not. Based in SG  Took grab for a year ++ Spend around 700++ and sadly never will I get to Gold member or even platinum membership. I really hope that grab would do something about this.

2017-09-05T04:31:26+0000,Ken Ken,5.07E+14,"Think it is the time to put to a stop this 1.35 and toddler issue or over capacity. Is all about contractual agreements between riders with UG and UG with drivers.  1) Contract between UG and Riders, is for UG to get the right car type to send rider from point A to B, but has UG done enough in rider booking app to ensure riders declare the mix of people taking the car? Since LTA and TP has such requirements, there is no wrong on UG to force riders to declare since is it a electronic service contract and the contract has to cover the drivers providing the service. Drivers has no contact and idea who are the riders before the booking and picking the riders, only UG has the mean to contact rider between themselves, more can be done before UG accepts rider's request and sending to drivers.  2) Contract between UG and drivers, is for drivers to fulfill jobs from UG to send their clients (riders) from point A to B. Right now drivers has zero ideas the mix riders they are picking until pickups, drivers should have the option to cancel the trip if the rider's mix is not as per LTA and TP requirements that cancellation should not impact their rating or incentives.  I am proposing that on rider's app, they have to declare if their rider mix has passenger below 1.35m and toddlers, if riders never declare but has such mix, the electronic service contract is consider null and void that driver's app should have the option to cancel without the fear of affecting their rating or incentives. In such cases, since driver already reached pick location and only to realize that riders falsely declared their rider mix, they can start the trip and end with special option indicating false rider declaration that a fee can be charged on rider for trip made to pick them. This will prevent riders from trying to book another car by falsely declaring rider mix.  Right now UG is making drivers or riders to communicate on LTA/TP requirements that has resulted in sour situations in who to cancel the trip if car cannot take the rider. All these are nonsenses, under the PHV new framework, UG has not done enough on ensuring right service to riders and riders both should be fined to if they insist on boarding a car that resulting in drivers caught breaking rules, else where is driver protection.",878098765675442_883877735097545,neutral

Not only was it difficult to get a cab as its forever on search mood..  Not like it was much cheaper..  From Heeren to woodlands $22+/- not much different from my usual uber ride.  Then I have balance $8 in my grab credit.   In order to use off this small amount I want to use for short distance But short distance your driver don't want to take..   So can I have my balance credit back to me cause I'm not interested to do with any of your Top up promotion.   Like I mention that was my first and my last.   Unless your company made it more flexible that after deducting the grabpay the rest can top up by cash or other payment.   If not please.  Give me back the balance.

So it's OKAY to penalise the passenger with a cancellation fee when they have to cancel due to long waiting time and it's perfectly acceptable for the passenger to WAIT 10-15mins.

2017-08-15T22:46:34+0000,Teck Lung NG,1.02E+16,"GrabShare is supposed to be shared rides for the grand objective to reduce cars in the roads and be green to environment.   Grab should actually only assign *matched* rides to drivers. If there's no match, the driver earns little because of the heavily discounted ride. Unmatched ride also defeats the spirits and grand purposes of ride sharing.   Try standing in the driver's shoes and you shall understand. The driver would have earned a higher  GrabCar fare for an unmatched GrabShare ride. Grab gives no options for them to opt out taking GrabShare jobs too.   This situation can be improved if Grab only assign *matched* GrabShare rides to drivers. And we are also aligning this service with its original grand purposes of reducing cars and greener to environment.  Another solution is to automatically revert the fare of an unmatched GrabShare ride to  GrabCar one upon completion of the job.",872581426227176_873349316150387,neutral

I tried to explained to him but he doesn't seems to understand.. the whole conversation lasted till he reaches the place that I was waiting, I was very upset and when I boarded the car he said I should have walked over to Blk 717 but I was carrying heavy items and that was the reason why i chose to take a cab as well.

From promos using grab to discount to 2nd ride promos using grabpay  to discount for 4 rides daily using Grab Credits to the current discount off 2nd ride only using Grab Credits.  Plus recently u have introduced cents into your grab fares and grab credits.  I'm not sure if you are trying to penalize loyal customers or just confident  that loyal customers cannot do without grab (since our credits are locked in the wallet).

As the rider gets off before erp .. so unfair 3- Thia happened today  the driver now says he daren't go into highway cos if there is a 2nd rider , he would have to come out from highway to pick up the other rider and results in a much more inconvenient route . So just so as to avoid the hassle of being tasked to take a second rider when along the highway , the driver chooses to go by the smaller roads And not the highway. - furthermore driver does not have the option to reject or close the app once on the highway.. unlike before.

Last week i took grab share with other passengers, and the ERP charge from the other passenger was charged to my account. Firstly, driver quietly deduct money under toll and others without telling me. This is very dishonest. Deduction of charges as such shuld be clearly communicated with the payers first isnt it? Secondly, the trip that required to pass through the ERP belongs to the other passenger hence it is  unfair to me to charge their ERP to my account. They could have chosen another route or alight before the ERP. If they make the decision to go through the ERP, i believe it is rightful for them to pay the ERP changes since i was not consulted and it is their sole decision. Pls review ur grabshare policy.

Not only that, your driver kept complaining that she wish she didnt take another ride because ""very difficult and inconvenient"" all thru the ride. I can fully understand what GrabShare is because I use grab on a daily basis, however, when I gave a 2 Star rating, I got an email from your Customer Service officer explaining what GrabShare is about. Please note that I do know how it works, but I was expressing my frustrations that the ride took more that it was expected because of the driver's carelessness into not looking where the drop of points are supposed to be and on top of that, complaining all thru our ride, when we, as passengers, had no complaints about it. And instead of your customer service officer admitting this fault, she told me to simply use Grab the next time instead of GrabShare.

I'm a platinum member with more than 25k plus points, so you can imagine the extent to which I use your service.   However I'm rather unhappy since I haven't gotten a ride for the past 6 days. Each time I try for about 15 minutes but in vain. You claim that you offer priority booking for platinum members but what kind of ""priority"" are you talking about when one of your most regular users using your app at least 2-3 times a day doesn't manage to book a ride for 6 days continuously? I usually switch between two apps - grab and comfort delgro. For the past 6 days I'm having to use comfort since my booking with the comfort delgro app is successful. I'm wondering why grab with such a huge fleet of both private cars and taxis (you're an aggregator) isn't able to provide its platinum member who at an average uses its service 2-3 times a day, with a ride when a comfort delgro with obviously a limited fleet of vehicles (relatively) is able to book me a ride successfully each time I try - be it peak or non peak hours. I'm even hearing this from my colleagues and friends too. If this continues, I'm sure customers will slowly but steadily start attriting. It'd be great if you could take this seriously and provide your super regular customers with a much better service.",846583225493663_847440095407976,negative

I must say, I am really really really very disappointed with the treatment I got for the past 2 weeks.   When you have your promo on topping up for 20% extra credit on 23/5/17, topped up $250.00 into grabpay but the app kept loading and did not acknowledge my transaction, thinking that the transaction didn't go through, I transferred $250.00 one more time and this time I received 2 messages which indicated that I have topped up $500 in total. I called your support team to ask for a refund and was advised to call my credit card to get my refund from credit card instead. So I did. But in the end, no refund was done and now my grab account got suspended!  In June I have topped up another 2 times of $50 each just to enjoy the $6 off promo and continued using the app until 10/06/17, I couldn't use the app and my balance of $449.70 was withdrawn from my account!  I have been calling your support team but no one can do anything about it. They can only ask me to wait for grabpay department to complete their investigation. I told the support team to get the person in charge to speak to me and the issue would resolve almost instantly but no one is interested to entertain me.  How much longer must I wait?

'6745L.... ah.... there, our car is here, come Alfonso!' Both guys hoped onto the red 6745L and started their touristy day..... they picked up their durian, reached Merlion Park, took photos, talked, laughed and pointed here and there..... then when their stomachs growled, Alan whipped out the durian and they sat down with Alan grabbing his share of the heavenly fruit, only to see Alfonso almost chocked by the smell..... Alan cried out laughing again but managed to persuade Alfonso to try the fruit.... Alfonso almost vomited & kindly rejected another bite, to which Alan grinned and said 'Oh well.... then I'm gonna finish them all..... you sure ah, you don't want?'

BUT it is super upsetting when a GRAB driver calls up to DEMAND we cancel our ride. what is worse, when we decline, he THREATENS ""then you have to wait until whatever time i come"". he claims that he has a passenger to drop off and he is on the highway, but from the point of booking there is no such indication, plus gps shows him nowhere near the highway. our only guess? it was a short distance, a six dollar ride which would be zero pay since we are enjoying the top up credit promotion. in the end, we had to wait for more than 15 minutes before we could ger another ride.   name of driver: ng chee kiang vehicle: SLK 3279T toyota wish",832715396880446_836653186486667,positive

She informed me that GRAB5 is only applicable for grabhitch rides. When I asked her to further investigate, she told me that I don't have a screenshot so there's nothing she can do. Is grab customer expected to take screenshot of all the promo codes redeemable ? Isn't that a great hassle for clients and we have to screenshot for fear that grab doesn't Honour the promo code ? I thought the system will auto disallow the promo code if it has been fully redeemed. When I keyed the promo code after the call, I was still able to apply the GRAB5 promo code.

And so I made sure I did so last night on June 3. To my dismay, I didn't get any promo code and re-read the conditions to learn that it actually said ""on"" June 4. I was very upset but figured Grab would be fair in hearing my case as this wasn't a $10 or $20 top up, but a $50 one. I asked for help on this issue but none of your reps seemed able to help.   I have no intention of asking for a refund and would only ask that Grab honour my act of buying $50 GrabPay credits due to your promotion. I unfortunately made a small error in misreading one word, which made all the difference. I would have asked for a refund and purchased the $50 again on June 4, but I was told that I cannot get a refund, and thus there was simply no alternative available. This has dented my faith in the approach towards customers but I'd like to ask that you consider flexibility in your policies. I don't even use any other hailing app but yours.   I hope to hear a positive reply from you.   Sincerely, Ariel",831728970312422_832272316924754,

2017-05-11T16:41:00+0000,Jamie Lim,1.02E+16,"Always your little girl 🙆 . A mother is the truest friend we have, the one who sticks with us through ups and down, go the extra mile to protects us, who shelters us when it gets dark and gloomy and celebrate your joys with the purest of heart. You never have to doubt her, because she is the one that loves you most and that is something that will never change.. for she is your mother . I never really realised how much I depended on my mother until I went on exchange. All my life, she has stuck by me and helped me through every life obstacle. From waking me up every morning to fetching me back home after a long day of school/work, she was always one step ahead so that we could have a comfortable life! Even as I set out on my 6months long exchange, she heavy-heartedly helped to pack my luggage and stuffed it full with all the instant local mixes you could find . Nearer to the date, she even surprised me by booking a flight just to follow me  and help me settle in ""I'm old enough to handle this on my own mum..."" I told her but she insisted. When I was there, I remembered feeling slightly annoyed that she was still ""bossing"" me around and nagging about safety... ""I can't wait for her to leave"" I thought to myself . . Oh but I was so wrong. As her departure date grew closer, I started to get more anxious. Finally the day came and as I waved goodbye to her at the train station, I looked into her soft gentle eyes and something in me caved in. Tears started to well up in my eyes. I was overwhelmed with emotions and this sudden panic about being without my mum! As she turned away from me, her smile dropped and for the first time I saw her sadness. That broke me completely and I burst into wild tears. Immediately, I dropped everything and chased madly after her. Crashing into her and hugging her really tight, ""Don't go!"" I cried as I tried my best to burrow into her soft embrace again. ""I love you..."" . I will never forget that moment. Nothing will ever compare to a mother's love and I am grateful for my mother, who have always stuck by me though good and bad times. I love you Mummy . . .

2017-05-11T16:01:44+0000,Lianchoo Low,4.76E+14,"Riding with Mum through my Life journeys versus riding together with Grab?  Honestly, Mum, from a humble background, never travels in a taxi nor gives me an opportunity to travel together in a cab as it is too costly n we must save for 'rainy days'!  So we always travel together by buses.   At a tender age. I always accompanied Mum wherever she went: to the market, temples or visiting relatives till my marriage in Sep 1977. We were very very close!  The old photo showed me, a young sweet girl at 14 with Mum at Ah Gong's house at Albert Street, after an hour journey from my kampong at Bukit Teresa. We had to walk 20 mins to the bus-stop but surprisingly then, I never complained because it was fun being with your loved one! When young, I don't resemble Mum. :)  The newer photo was taken last Jul at Alive Museum to celebrate Mum's birthday with my Dad and two Brothers. One Brother was the chauffeur then.  We chose Alive Museum because we wanted our parents to try being creative; to pose with whatever there! Something parents had never done before.   Indeed, it was really fun seeing Mum laughing loudly there.  But I still loved this photo best of all. The backdrop of a BIG RED LOVE of leaves gave me the courage to tell Mum the three golden words 'I LOVE YOU!'  That was our glorious moments!   At their twilight years (86 and 91) for the past seven years, we have weekly outings to the movies, shopping malls followed by lunch. We know that they look forward to these.  Take a closer look at this photo. Now at 62, I really resemble Mum: our size and full round faces!   Hope to win free JustGrab rides to change her mindset: that the cab rides are very comfortable especially for their ages, very convenient, very fast and actually affordable!   Pampering Mum with a bouquet of carnations, cake or dinner are pretty common but blessing  her with free taxi rides is INDEED UNIQUE!  She's a special Mum so she deserves special moments!  Thank you, Mom: for giving me the gift of life, caring diligently for me as a premature baby and teaching me patiently moral values, nursed me often when I had very bad asthmatic attacks especially in the middle of the night. Yet not a word of complaint nor thought of abandoning this baby/child and your SLEEPLESS NIGHTS didn't affect your cherry performance the next day as a housewife and Mum to five kids. Kudos to you, Mum!  When I lost my first foetus followed by 6 months of aggressive treatments in 1978, you were there with me, for me, urging me to be optimistic and to nourish me well you cooked delicious meals for me as this was my 'confinement month'! My world nearly collapsed then!  It was you who tenderly and slowly guided me through my  life's most difficult period! My depressive and crying bouts, for months, must have worried you terribly, yet you forced herself to put on a brave front for my sake! Thank you, Mum for being my PILLAR OF SUPPORT and riding with me through my deepest LOW in life!  Your unconditional selfless love, cheerful disposition, and forgiveness for my mistakes, greatly touched me!  There were times when I was disobedient and drove you up the wall, yet you patiently explained to me after your punishment.  How could I not improve to be a better person to repay your love and kindness?  I controlled my temper and learnt from you the virtues of patience, tolerance and perseverance. These are your strength. Your good characteristic traits!   No wonder people commented that MOTHER'S LOVE IS THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD! ❤️❤️  Mom, I am proud of you, elated to have you as my Mom and never ever will trade you for other woman!  Now, in your twilight years, it's my turn to cherish and support you anytime!  HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!  TO MY SUPERMOM!  My WONDERWOMAN!  Let's grab this opportunity to ride Grab taxi FOR FREE! Cheers!!  Thanks for your fabulous giveaway! To pamper the most important WOMAN in my life!

2017-05-12T10:36:23+0000,Elena Tang WenFang,8.78E+14,"More than 40 years ago I was still a scrawny girl living in a poor country side in Fujian ,China and mum did a lot of chores like tiling the land,feeding the fowls,growing and watering the crops,picking and selecting seeds for sowing again to ensure optimum growth of cash crops for sale to feed the family.              With the hardship experienced,Mum developed and instilled in me too such good traits as kindness,compassion and dedication for which she earned everyone's respect from the countryside we once lived.                Time flies like the flicked pages of a book as I am now happily married and have become a Simgapore Citizen together with mum.              Time has changed my face and mum's face too but it has not changed our love for each other.  I am  now the proud mother of a 8 year old boy and glad that at least I am doing a small part of National Service by contributing to the dwindling Singapore's population.I may opt for more children in line with Singapore Government's procreation policies and of course not forgetting mum's ever ready assistance.  Thank you Mum for taking this long ride all the way from China and accompanying me and finally making this little red dot our beloved country for all of us to sink our roots here.  Mum I hope to win so that being a very thrifty person you will  complain no more about the high transport cost when moving about in Singapore and this is made possible with the compliments of Grab.  #ridingwithmumSG",818443518307634_820525371432782,positive

In the 1960/1970s, you had to take on several jobs--seamstress,an amah,going from street to street picking old cans/bottles and used clothings for sale and peddling homemade food like nasi-lemak and kueh kueh. You did all those jobs just to supplement dad's meagre as a manual worker.You had no eduaction but you could teach us to distinguish between right and wrong, support and encourage  us in our studies and all your five children have  always excelled in their studies and graduated from universities holding respectable jobs-lawyer,engineer,system manager and tutor attributed mainly to your efforts and diligence .            You donate  generously to temples, mosques and churches without discrimination and stress the importance of racial and ethnic tolerance and mutual respect for one another-a key criterion for survival of Singapore.              You imbue in me to visit old folks home, orphanages and shelter homes for ex-drug addicts/offenders to cheer and bring hope and financial assistance whenever possible.               You  babysit for our neighbours' kids and elderly folks,sew their clothes and provide groceries and food to those in need.You love to whip up your favourite curry chicken,chicken rice,poh piah,cakes and desserts and invite friends,acquaintances and neighbours for the kampung spirit get together atmosphere.  Mum,thank you for everything you have done for the me ,the neighbours and the community and I hope the generous sponsor /organiser Grab will reward you as you have gone beyond helping and encouraging me as you are also the pride of our neighbours,the community and also our Nation being the pioneer generation, you are really that ""Here For Me""  who deserves a treat for your contributions from Grab as you have touched many lives too and this May is also your Diamond Wedding Anniversary to our beloved dad so I hope to win this reward for you .  The left photo here is more than 50 years ago when you carried a helpless toddler like me then but today thanks to your upbringing,I am successful in my own ventures and happily married with a daughter which is also your favourite grandaughter so it is now my turn to take good care of you and thank you for being my greatest driver throughout our life journeys because without you we are like passengers without destination-- On behalf of my siblings I want to wish you❤❤❤❤ HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ and thank you Grab again for organising such a meaningful contest. #ridingwithmumSG",818443518307634_820486328103353,positive

But may I add that there should be an avenue for Drivers to repudiate any 2 stars or below ratings. Reason being some riders can be a little too harsh or vindictive, counting every little infraction against the driver. A driver ought to be able to refute any accusations of unsafe or unprofessional ratings as it will eventually count against the driver and may end up in his/her termination.  While I understand it is ""industry practice"" to protect the rider's anonymity so as to encourage a better rate of participation in giving Drivers ratings, the anonymity could also unfortunately be grossly unfair for the driver.  While I also agree that  high frequency of Low ratings will stand to prove the driver's unprofessionalism, the fact that a single 1 star rating can already adversely affect the driver's overall standing and reputation.",813102838841702_814557108696275,

Most of the passenger does not know that if driver wait more than 5 minutes there is $3 surcharge.  If go to more than 1 location there is surcharge of $5.  If you change place to further than the location booked there is extra charges. If lesser paid as booked. ERP and toll paid by passenger.  Non of this was educate to passenger. ( please be noted that I am a Grab user). I know this from your driver but not from your company. So for mutual respect between drivers and passengers it is your responsibility as the service provider to explain to both passengers and drivers if not passengers may argue with drivers and vise versa.",804501683035151_805321642953155,

But wads the pt of offering all these discounts if most of ur customers are unable to use them? Knowing that a huge percentage of ur customers are currently affected by the GrabPay issues, the least u could do if you want to offer these discounts is to make them available for cash payment too. That would make more sense. Its like having a store promotion of 50% off all products by nets payment but then all ur nets terminals are down.

Yes it was the morning but just to be clear, we took a grabcar to the bar. We were getting really high on Guinness and Ahteo came up with a brilliant idea of pretending to be a woman to impress the waiter so maybe we can get more beers! When you're having beers, naturally everything you hear sounds like a bloody good plan. So I got him to stand up and he tucked in his shirt and we had to find a way to hide the bulge in his pants. I suggested a tape but Ahteo looked down and realized it was just his stuff that was parked wrongly. So he did a good squat and the bulge was gone. Then I went on cutting pieces of paper in the shape of spaghetti. We stuck all that on his head and crumpled more papers into balls and put them under his shirt. He looked absolutely hideous. But we went for it anyway. He did a sweet dogwalk into the bar and tried his best to seduce the bartender. Obviously, he was ignored and was brushed off as a regular drunkard just roaming around trying to find meaning in life. And then Ahteo came up with another idea to seduce him. He started softly singing Beyond's greatest hit, Hai Kuo Tian Kong.   ""Gam tin ngoh hon ye lui hon seuit piu gwoh waai jeuk laang keuk liu dik sam woh piu yuan fong.....""  The bartender froze. Ahteo started smiling. The bartender turned and as I slowly walked towards Ahteo, I started seeing teardrops down the bartender's cheek. It was happening. What initially came off as the stupidest plan for anyone to come up with, was actually working! I inched closer and the bartender slid his hands past the bartop, grabbed a bottle of whiskey and broke it on Ahteo's head! I was startled! What an unexpected yet interesting turn of events! It was rather clear that the plan has burnt to ashes now. Ahteo was screaming in pain while the bartender started yelling ""HOW DARE YOU SPOIL THE BEST SONG EVER CREATED"" and well, I didn't have much of a choice but to agree with him as in all honesty, Ahteo ruined the song. The bartender calmed down, came over to us, helped Ahteo up. We put him on a chair and wrapped his head with the papers we used for his fake breasts. The bartender apologized for breaking the bottle on his head and wasting all the whiskey. He knew we hated to waste them. Ahteo hugged him and they both had a small funeral for the whiskey that was poured. Following that, we had free flow Guinness all night. We paid only $10 a pint each and I drank for $1000. Well, Ahteo drank about $1000 worth of cider instead because after the stunt he pulled off, he found out he actually liked dressing up as a woman.   We got more for less! Ahteo's head wasn't worth anything since it's empty anyway.",776251279193525_776382202513766,neutral

So out of curiousity, I questioned the cashier on why did we get a discount? She said ""oh because the chef said the lobsters were not as fresh today. So we can't compromise on quality.""

So any opportunity to get more bang for our buck would definitely be utilised.  On one particular ""date day out"", we'd single-handedly managed to accomplish 3 activities without forking out a single cent (not including public transport!)  1: Watching a weekend movie (courtesy of me winning an internal company award and scoring movie tickets, yeeeeba!)  2: A public exhibition (and a pretty interesting one at that coz it was about defence) and finally,  3: A FREE dinner (the ultimate clincher, please don't stop reading). So after dinner and in our haste to get home to catch the last train (all you last train folks, I'm sure ya feel me 😂), we hurriedly settled the bill without looking and raced to the station. But I had a niggling feeling there was something weird with the numbers. While we were on the train home, I was looking at the receipt and found out why - the restaurant had undercharged us by accident! >.< My SO then piped up, ""Actually, that dinner was also free coz I paid for it with the $10 we picked up at Sentosa last week"" 😂😅  So number 3 honestly isn't the best highlight (coz I do still feel bad!) but this Date Day Out was truly #MoreForLess.   cc Shawn Goh my fave partner-in-crime 😘. now everyone knows how cheap we are! hehehhe #sayitloudsayitproud #pigebuaytahan #cheepcheap 😂 also, #BallinWithGrab !!!",776251279193525_778706025614717,

There were always vouchers for sale for like 40% or  50% off. What more could we ask for? Then my boyfriend introduced me to shopback. This allowed the money spent on groupon vouchers to earn cash back as well. Whatttttt? Discounts on discount vouchers? It gets even better. Whenever Grab comes out with a promo code, we'll always remember to exploit it to the max. Sometimes a 5 dollar promo code would mean a 2 dollar grabshare ride to the restaurant. That's what I would call getting bangs for my buck. #BallinWithGrab",776251279193525_778627815622538,

If u still remember those stretch of open air bbq near the marina bowling alley. Now all closed down liao. That night we went and had a great feast bbq-ing and finally we were the few last customers around, then the boss came to us and happily passed us two complimentary potong ice cream and ""said xiao mei mei xiao di, eat slowly ah don't worry"". We thank him and while we continue to feast we notice him clearing up some tables as usual then all of a sudden the staff all disappeared. It was 1am or later. Guess what we haven't even foot the bill!

We got very frustrated after trying unsuccessfully to affix the second hand and the minute hand to the clock face for an hour. I called the seller's contact and was taught over the phone but were still unsuccessful. At the end, he got my address and presented himself at my doorstep hours later with a fully assembled wall clock. I offered to return him the clock on hand but he refused and just left. Undeterred, Lynette and I tried again trying to assemble it without fearing of breaking the hands since another one has been given to me. We were finally successful. We felt bad getting two wall clocks for the price of one. I went to the marketplace platform and left him a compliment, thanking him for his initiative and fast response to my requests. We had hoped for assistance via phone but got a second clock, assembled instead is really beyond our expectations. Till today, both wall clocks are still working well in the living room and bedroom.  #BallinWithGrab",776251279193525_778472412304745,

Having seen that, he insisted on waiting for me to go home to take my IC, send me to A&E , while he load the books into his car. When we reached the hospital, he refused to accept any money. It was because of his kindness that i received prompt medical attention. He is none other than Mr. Muhammad Yazid Bin Alwi, a man with big heart.

Like a usual night on 25 Jan, I took a grab car back home from my mum's place to my own after picking up my toddler. I was pleasantly surprised to get an instant text from the driver that he would be earlier than the booked timing! He told me no worries and he will wait for me with his easily recognisable car with pepsi decal. At times it is hard to recognise the car late night and I appreciate that little gesture.  Headed down with my toddler early since I was tired from the long day and can't wait to be home. Although it was a short journey with slight drizzling, it was an enjoyable chat with the driver and my toddler was also listening attentively.  Bided goodbye and upon reaching home, I realised that my mum's home-baked Kueh Lapis cake was left in the car. I didn't want to disturb the driver since it's so late at night. In 5 mins, I got a text with three missed calls if the cake belongs to me. Didn't want to inconvenience him but the driver insisted on returning it to me. In 5 mins, the driver was back to where he alighted me. The cakes were back in my hands!  Thank you Mr Vicvic Ang of SJU 3029U for your kindness and taking the trouble to return my items to me. It may just be a small gesture for you but to me, you ended a stranger's long day so well!  Having to juggle motherhood and full-time work can be tiring with time being of essence, so Grab taxis have been my best friend. And it's drivers like Mr Vic that keep me going/clicking all the time.

He patiently sent us there and told us how to inform Grab when we book next time. Also, happen that my friend's elder daughter accidentally left her handphone at the back car seat's door holder. We did not realized it until we have all gotten down the car and it has been driven away for awhile. I called up the driver immediately and he was very kind and stopped at the roadside he was already driving on, and searched for the handphone, while I was waiting on the line to hear good news hopefully that the handphone was still around and thank God it was. But as the driver couldn't come back to where my friend stays to return the hand phone that day due to urgent valid reason; and he kindly offered to hold it and return it to my friend the following day, arranging a convenient place for them to meet and return the handphone to them. He was very honest and fast to respond and willing to directly arrange w my friend on the handphone return, which was done smoothly.

I encountered bad experience with grabshare Drivers who insisted driving through multiple CTE tolls when the alternative route of the other passenger and me is almost same distance and toll free. Drivers argued that we are already paying a ""cheaper fare"" and cannot choose route! In the end, the fare were most expensive than GrabCar where I can choose the toll free route and reaching my destination in a shorter time due to no sharing.  My daily destination is from Toa Payoh Central to Orchard where my usual route is PIE > Stevens Road > Orchard but grabshare Drivers just want to drive via Balestier > CTE > Orchard. At peak hours, CTE is really too expensive. :( If you check google map, the travelling time is almost the same.  Drivers do not feel the pinch because passengers are the one paying and I am not sure why Drivers simply love CTE so much. Of course, they are some Drivers who are very kind and understanding but it is really very rare.",736601583158495_737391639746156,negative

I've booked a ride thinking I'm still using Android Pay to find that I'm stuck on a ride with no cash on me. Called the Grab  hotline, been put on hold twice, spent 25 minutes with the phone glued to my ear only to have Lisa tell me that she does not know what went wrong and pretending that she does not know about this Android promotion I'm talking about. And she suggests that she will get someone from Grab Pay to contact me...  Hello! I pressed ""3"" for ""GrabPay"" on your automated phone menu, if the person talking to me does not know about Grab Pay and its promotions then what sort of help desk have you setup? I can only conclude that Grab has set this up as a hoax, to entice riders to take at least 7-8 rides then ensure that we will not be able to fulfill the 9th ride prior to 1st Jan so that they do not need to unlock the $15 free ride as promised.

Why should passenger B need to share or even pay ERP charges if picked up within ERP zones? With UberPool, UberX or GrabCar, in such a scenario when the rider is picked up inside ERP zones, no surcharges are levied, if I'm not mistaken.   If passenger A's pickup AND drop off points are both outside the ERP zones, why should he/she pay the ERP charges? It should be borne 💯% by the driver as it's not A's fault or requirement to enter the ERP zone. Again passenger B is not liable either as when B is being picked up within the CBD zone, previously they're not assessed with any toll charges at all under UberPool, UberX or GrabCar unless they again enter through another ERP zone gantry for any reason. The driver wants to pick up an extra fare inside the CBD zone so should bear the ERP toll.  This does not however apply when ERP is imcurred on highways and both passenger A & B are INSIDE the car. Both parties should however be asked by the driver for permission to take the tolled highway option when other non toll optional routes are available for use, BOTH passengers A and B Must agree too of course.

Subsequently, the driver left the donated items on the door step of your Jurong East office that looks closed (through pictures that he sent to me).  I called up the call centre again and the lady on the phone simply told me someone will take care of it.  Plus I have asked for her help since the ride was suppose to be sponsored yet my card was charged.  She wasn't able to get hold of another colleague who would help to resolve the charge issue and said would call me back.  At the end of the call, I asked for her name and she refused to tell me.

2016-12-06T10:58:29+0000,Peter Chua,1.02E+16,"I do grab hitch sometimes and i would like to share some tips for pax to have a better chance to get a hitch ride:  1) answer the phone call when the driver call u. I wont proceed to pick a pax if he or she doesnt answer the call. Many pax do not cancel their booking even when they no longer need it as there is no penalty not to do so. So i don't want to make a wasted trip. Already even with a confirmation over the phone, i have on 3 occasions arrived at the pick up points n the pax didn't turn up n didnt answer the calls. I called grab to ask them to blacklist these idiots. Some pax are also strange. They dunt answer call but sms the driver instead. Driver is driving. How to text n drive at the same time?  2) indicate your address clearly. Dunt just put postal code. Drivers have many hitch requests. We won't waste time to check where is your postal codes   3) Hitch is different from grab car. We are not a cheaper version of grab car. Don't treat us like grab drivers. And in any case, pax should respect grab drivers who are making an honest living.  I have a friend who is a full time grab driver. He took a booking from a certain FT. When he arrived, the pax scolded him and asked why he was 2 minutes later than the time indicated in the apps? He then asked my friend if he knows how much he earns n wasting time is wasting his money.  Seriously, i dunt think any driver care about how much any pax earn.  They are just there to bring u from point A to point B safely.  In any case, if u r earning a lot, u shouldnt be booking a grab economy. U should have your own luxury car with a personal chauffeur. I took a booking from a FT. His fare was only $5. He behaved like he is paying $50. If i ever see his name again, i wont take his booking.",726134244205229_726307127521274,
