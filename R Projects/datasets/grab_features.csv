6,Kazuya Tann,1.53E+15,"Lets talk about grab pay.   In Malaysia, for grab pay, RM 1 = 10 points (pts) So to get a Silver membership, you need 1000 pts, which means you need to spend RM100. (1000pts) For Gold membership, you need 3000 pts, which means you need to spend RM 300. (3000pts) For Platinum membership, you need 8000 pts, which means you need to spend RM800. (8000 pts)   So lets talk about Singapores grab pay.   In Singapore, for grab pay, SGD1 = 16pts  So to get a Silver membership, you need 3000 pts, which means you need to spend SGD187.50. (3000pts) For Gold membership, you need 9000 pts, which means you need to spend SGD562.50. (9000pts) For Platinum membership, you need 19000 pts, which means you need to spend SGD1187.50. (19000 pts)   I would have easily gotten platinum membership if I am in Malaysia. Sadly, I am not. Based in SG  Took grab for a year  Spend around 700 and sadly never will I get to Gold member or even platinum membership. I really hope that grab would do something about this. Maybe change the points system by letting us earn more points or maybe lower down the points for us to reach the membership. Thankyou.",4479,neutral,8/29/2017 21:33,21,2,204,0.111111111,0,2,3,0

In order to use off this small amount I want to use for short distance But short distance your driver don't want to take..   So can I have my balance credit back to me cause I'm not interested to do with any of your Top up promotion.   Like I mention that was my first and my last.   Unless your company made it more flexible that after deducting the grabpay the rest can top up by cash or other payment.   If not please.  Give me back the balance.

Grab should actually only assign *matched* rides to drivers. If there's no match, the driver earns little because of the heavily discounted ride. Unmatched ride also defeats the spirits and grand purposes of ride sharing.   Try standing in the driver's shoes and you shall understand. The driver would have earned a higher  GrabCar fare for an unmatched GrabShare ride. Grab gives no options for them to opt out taking GrabShare jobs too.   This situation can be improved if Grab only assign *matched* GrabShare rides to drivers. And we are also aligning this service with its original grand purposes of reducing cars and greener to environment.  Another solution is to automatically revert the fare of an unmatched GrabShare ride to  GrabCar one upon completion of the job.",4229,neutral,8/16/2017 14:46,14,3,148,1.5,0,3,9,0

I tried to explained to him but he doesn't seems to understand.. the whole conversation lasted till he reaches the place that I was waiting, I was very upset and when I boarded the car he said I should have walked over to Blk 717 but I was carrying heavy items and that was the reason why i chose to take a cab as well.

As the rider gets off before erp .. so unfair 3 Thia happened today  the driver now says he daren't go into highway cos if there is a 2nd rider , he would have to come out from highway to pick up the other rider and results in a much more inconvenient route . So just so as to avoid the hassle of being tasked to take a second rider when along the highway , the driver chooses to go by the smaller roads And not the highway.  furthermore driver does not have the option to reject or close the app once on the highway.. unlike before. Now they are no longer given any option and this is really making a mockery out of the drivers And riders ..  please listen to feedback given and do something soon .

Last week i took grab share with other passengers, and the ERP charge from the other passenger was charged to my account. Firstly, driver quietly deduct money under toll and others without telling me. This is very dishonest. Deduction of charges as such shuld be clearly communicated with the payers first isnt it? Secondly, the trip that required to pass through the ERP belongs to the other passenger hence it is  unfair to me to charge their ERP to my account. They could have chosen another route or alight before the ERP. If they make the decision to go through the ERP, i believe it is rightful for them to pay the ERP changes since i was not consulted and it is their sole decision. Pls review ur grabshare policy.

I told the driver to alight her first as she seems in a distraught manner. Driver also waived the $3 late charges as she was rushing to get food for her mum whos waiting at the hospital. We calmed her down and was trying to make her not so panic. I understand the situation by sharing my experience about my dad who was hospitalised too for one month due to some infection. I just wanted to tell her that therr will be a point of time in life where things Don't go our way but with a lil bit of prayer n faith im sure everything will be fine. She alighted with tears on her eyes and said thank u for making her felt better during the ride.we became friends ever since.

She said it indeed was and she pointed to me that the sheltered open space was great for hanging around as it was cozy and airy.   I then plucked up the courage to ask her what her husband's job was that made her live a life of a Tai Tai. She smiled, told me that it was her who paid for most of her condo purchase, and invited me to tea sometime and she would tell me more then.

Not only that, your driver kept complaining that she wish she didnt take another ride because ""very difficult and inconvenient"" all thru the ride. I can fully understand what GrabShare is because I use grab on a daily basis, however, when I gave a 2 Star rating, I got an email from your Customer Service officer explaining what GrabShare is about. Please note that I do know how it works, but I was expressing my frustrations that the ride took more that it was expected because of the driver's carelessness into not looking where the drop of points are supposed to be and on top of that, complaining all thru our ride, when we, as passengers, had no complaints about it. And instead of your customer service officer admitting this fault, she told me to simply use Grab the next time instead of GrabShare.

I'm a platinum member with more than 25k plus points, so you can imagine the extent to which I use your service.   However I'm rather unhappy since I haven't gotten a ride for the past 6 days. Each time I try for about 15 minutes but in vain. You claim that you offer priority booking for platinum members but what kind of ""priority"" are you talking about when one of your most regular users using your app at least 23 times a day doesn't manage to book a ride for 6 days continuously? I usually switch between two apps  grab and comfort delgro. For the past 6 days I'm having to use comfort since my booking with the comfort delgro app is successful. I'm wondering why grab with such a huge fleet of both private cars and taxis (you're an aggregator) isn't able to provide its platinum member who at an average uses its service 23 times a day, with a ride when a comfort delgro with obviously a limited fleet of vehicles (relatively) is able to book me a ride successfully each time I try  be it peak or non peak hours. I'm even hearing this from my colleagues and friends too. If this continues, I'm sure customers will slowly but steadily start attriting.

Alfonso almost vomited & kindly rejected another bite, to which Alan grinned and said 'Oh well.... then I'm gonna finish them all..... you sure ah, you don't want?'

And so I made sure I did so last night on June 3. To my dismay, I didn't get any promo code and reread the conditions to learn that it actually said ""on"" June 4.

I have no intention of asking for a refund and would only ask that Grab honour my act of buying $50 GrabPay credits due to your promotion. I unfortunately made a small error in misreading one word, which made all the difference. I would have asked for a refund and purchased the $50 again on June 4, but I was told that I cannot get a refund, and thus there was simply no alternative available.

A mother is the truest friend we have, the one who sticks with us through ups and down, go the extra mile to protects us, who shelters us when it gets dark and gloomy and celebrate your joys with the purest of heart. You never have to doubt her, because she is the one that loves you most and that is something that will never change.. for she is your mother . I never really realised how much I depended on my mother until I went on exchange. All my life, she has stuck by me and helped me through every life obstacle. From waking me up every morning to fetching me back home after a long day of school/work, she was always one step ahead so that we could have a comfortable life! Even as I set out on my 6months long exchange, she heavyheartedly helped to pack my luggage and stuffed it full with all the instant local mixes you could find . Nearer to the date, she even surprised me by booking a flight just to follow me  and help me settle in ""I'm old enough to handle this on my own mum..."" I told her but she insisted. When I was there, I remembered feeling slightly annoyed that she was still ""bossing"" me around and nagging about safety... ""I can't wait for her to leave"" I thought to myself . . Oh but I was so wrong. As her departure date grew closer, I started to get more anxious. Finally the day came and as I waved goodbye to her at the train station, I looked into her soft gentle eyes and something in me caved in. Tears started to well up in my eyes. I was overwhelmed with emotions and this sudden panic about being without my mum! As she turned away from me, her smile dropped and for the first time I saw her sadness. That broke me completely and I burst into wild tears. Immediately, I dropped everything and chased madly after her. Crashing into her and hugging her really tight, ""Don't go!"" I cried as I tried my best to burrow into her soft embrace again. ""I love you..."" . I will never forget that moment. Nothing will ever compare to a mother's love and I am grateful for my mother, who have always stuck by me though good and bad times. I love you Mummy . . .

1883,Lianchoo Low,4.76E+14,"Riding with Mum through my Life journeys versus riding together with Grab?  Honestly, Mum, from a humble background, never travels in a taxi nor gives me an opportunity to travel together in a cab as it is too costly n we must save for 'rainy days'!  So we always travel together by buses.   At a tender age. I always accompanied Mum wherever she went: to the market, temples or visiting relatives till my marriage in Sep 1977. We were very very close!  The old photo showed me, a young sweet girl at 14 with Mum at Ah Gong's house at Albert Street, after an hour journey from my kampong at Bukit Teresa. We had to walk 20 mins to the busstop but surprisingly then, I never complained because it was fun being with your loved one! When young, I don't resemble Mum. :)  The newer photo was taken last Jul at Alive Museum to celebrate Mum's birthday with my Dad and two Brothers. One Brother was the chauffeur then.  We chose Alive Museum because we wanted our parents to try being creative; to pose with whatever there! Something parents had never done before.   Indeed, it was really fun seeing Mum laughing loudly there.  But I still loved this photo best of all. The backdrop of a BIG RED LOVE of leaves gave me the courage to tell Mum the three golden words 'I LOVE YOU!'  That was our glorious moments!   At their twilight years (86 and 91) for the past seven years, we have weekly outings to the movies, shopping malls followed by lunch. We know that they look forward to these.  Take a closer look at this photo. Now at 62, I really resemble Mum: our size and full round faces!   Hope to win free JustGrab rides to change her mindset: that the cab rides are very comfortable especially for their ages, very convenient, very fast and actually affordable!   Pampering Mum with a bouquet of carnations, cake or dinner are pretty common but blessing  her with free taxi rides is INDEED UNIQUE!  She's a special Mum so she deserves special moments!  Thank you, Mom: for giving me the gift of life, caring diligently for me as a premature baby and teaching me patiently moral values, nursed me often when I had very bad asthmatic attacks especially in the middle of the night. Yet not a word of complaint nor thought of abandoning this baby/child and your SLEEPLESS NIGHTS didn't affect your cherry performance the next day as a housewife and Mum to five kids. Kudos to you, Mum!  When I lost my first foetus followed by 6 months of aggressive treatments in 1978, you were there with me, for me, urging me to be optimistic and to nourish me well you cooked delicious meals for me as this was my 'confinement month'! My world nearly collapsed then!  It was you who tenderly and slowly guided me through my  life's most difficult period! My depressive and crying bouts, for months, must have worried you terribly, yet you forced herself to put on a brave front for my sake! Thank you, Mum for being my PILLAR OF SUPPORT and riding with me through my deepest LOW in life!  Your unconditional selfless love, cheerful disposition, and forgiveness for my mistakes, greatly touched me!  There were times when I was disobedient and drove you up the wall, yet you patiently explained to me after your punishment.  How could I not improve to be a better person to repay your love and kindness?  I controlled my temper and learnt from you the virtues of patience, tolerance and perseverance. These are your strength. Your good characteristic traits!   No wonder people commented that MOTHER'S LOVE IS THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD!   Mom, I am proud of you, elated to have you as my Mom and never ever will trade you for other woman!  Now, in your twilight years, it's my turn to cherish and support you anytime!  HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!  TO MY SUPERMOM!  My WONDERWOMAN!  Let's grab this opportunity to ride Grab taxi FOR FREE! Cheers!!  Thanks for your fabulous giveaway!

1884,Elena Tang WenFang,8.78E+14,"More than 40 years ago I was still a scrawny girl living in a poor country side in Fujian ,China and mum did a lot of chores like tiling the land,feeding the fowls,growing and watering the crops,picking and selecting seeds for sowing again to ensure optimum growth of cash crops for sale to feed the family.              With the hardship experienced,Mum developed and instilled in me too such good traits as kindness,compassion and dedication for which she earned everyone's respect from the countryside we once lived.                Time flies like the flicked pages of a book as I am now happily married and have become a Simgapore Citizen together with mum.              Time has changed my face and mum's face too but it has not changed our love for each other.  I am  now the proud mother of a 8 year old boy and glad that at least I am doing a small part of National Service by contributing to the dwindling Singapore's population.I may opt for more children in line with Singapore Government's procreation policies and of course not forgetting mum's ever ready assistance.  Thank you Mum for taking this long ride all the way from China and accompanying me and finally making this little red dot our beloved country for all of us to sink our roots here.  Mum I hope to win so that being a very thrifty person you will  complain no more about the high transport cost when moving about in Singapore and this is made possible with the compliments of Grab.  #ridingwithmumSG",2577,positive,5/13/2017 2:36,2,6,255,1.333333333,0,4,8,2

In the 1960/1970s, you had to take on several jobsseamstress,an amah,going from street to street picking old cans/bottles and used clothings for sale and peddling homemade food like nasilemak and kueh kueh. You did all those jobs just to supplement dad's meagre as a manual worker.You had no eduaction but you could teach us to distinguish between right and wrong, support and encourage  us in our studies and all your five children have  always excelled in their studies and graduated from universities holding respectable jobslawyer,engineer,system manager and tutor attributed mainly to your efforts and diligence .            You donate  generously to temples, mosques and churches without discrimination and stress the importance of racial and ethnic tolerance and mutual respect for one anothera key criterion for survival of Singapore.              You imbue in me to visit old folks home, orphanages and shelter homes for exdrug addicts/offenders to cheer and bring hope and financial assistance whenever possible.               You  babysit for our neighbours' kids and elderly folks,sew their clothes and provide groceries and food to those in need.You love to whip up your favourite curry chicken,chicken rice,poh piah,cakes and desserts and invite friends,acquaintances and neighbours for the kampung spirit get together atmosphere.  Mum,thank you for everything you have done for the me ,the neighbours and the community and I hope the generous sponsor /organiser Grab will reward you as you have gone beyond helping and encouraging me as you are also the pride of our neighbours,the community and also our Nation being the pioneer generation, you are really that ""Here For Me""  who deserves a treat for your contributions from Grab as you have touched many lives too and this May is also your Diamond Wedding Anniversary to our beloved dad so I hope to win this reward for you .  The left photo here is more than 50 years ago when you carried a helpless toddler like me then but today thanks to your upbringing,I am successful in my own ventures and happily married with a daughter which is also your favourite grandaughter so it is now my turn to take good care of you and thank you for being my greatest driver throughout our life journeys because without you we are like passengers without destination On behalf of my siblings I want to wish you HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY and thank you Grab again for organising such a meaningful contest. #ridingwithmumSG",2576,positive,5/13/2017 1:10,1,6,428,1.75,0,3,29,2

2176,Roland Chua,1.02E+16,"Sounds like Grab is taking after Uber's methodology...  But may I add that there should be an avenue for Drivers to repudiate any 2 stars or below ratings. Reason being some riders can be a little too harsh or vindictive, counting every little infraction against the driver. A driver ought to be able to refute any accusations of unsafe or unprofessional ratings as it will eventually count against the driver and may end up in his/her termination.  While I understand it is ""industry practice"" to protect the rider's anonymity so as to encourage a better rate of participation in giving Drivers ratings, the anonymity could also unfortunately be grossly unfair for the driver.  While I also agree that  high frequency of Low ratings will stand to prove the driver's unprofessionalism, the fact that a single 1 star rating can already adversely affect the driver's overall standing and reputation.",2292,,5/2/2017 11:46,11,2,148,-0.222222222,0,4,4,0

Most of the passenger does not know that if driver wait more than 5 minutes there is $3 surcharge.  If go to more than 1 location there is surcharge of $5.  If you change place to further than the location booked there is extra charges. If lesser paid as booked. ERP and toll paid by passenger.  Non of this was educate to passenger. ( please be noted that I am a Grab user). I know this from your driver but not from your company. So for mutual respect between drivers and passengers it is your responsibility as the service provider to explain to both passengers and drivers if not passengers may argue with drivers and vise versa.",2095,,4/17/2017 6:37,6,1,135,1.25,0,0,3,0

Knowing that a huge percentage of ur customers are currently affected by the GrabPay issues, the least u could do if you want to offer these discounts is to make them available for cash payment too.

3126,Jaarvis Ali,1.68E+15,"One fine morning, I was having some beers with my buddy Jason Teo whom I will hereon refer to as Ahteo. Yes it was the morning but just to be clear, we took a grabcar to the bar. We were getting really high on Guinness and Ahteo came up with a brilliant idea of pretending to be a woman to impress the waiter so maybe we can get more beers! When you're having beers, naturally everything you hear sounds like a bloody good plan. So I got him to stand up and he tucked in his shirt and we had to find a way to hide the bulge in his pants. I suggested a tape but Ahteo looked down and realized it was just his stuff that was parked wrongly. So he did a good squat and the bulge was gone. Then I went on cutting pieces of paper in the shape of spaghetti. We stuck all that on his head and crumpled more papers into balls and put them under his shirt. He looked absolutely hideous. But we went for it anyway. He did a sweet dogwalk into the bar and tried his best to seduce the bartender. Obviously, he was ignored and was brushed off as a regular drunkard just roaming around trying to find meaning in life. And then Ahteo came up with another idea to seduce him. He started softly singing Beyond's greatest hit, Hai Kuo Tian Kong.   ""Gam tin ngoh hon ye lui hon seuit piu gwoh waai jeuk laang keuk liu dik sam woh piu yuan fong.....""  The bartender froze. Ahteo started smiling. The bartender turned and as I slowly walked towards Ahteo, I started seeing teardrops down the bartender's cheek. It was happening. What initially came off as the stupidest plan for anyone to come up with, was actually working! I inched closer and the bartender slid his hands past the bartop, grabbed a bottle of whiskey and broke it on Ahteo's head! I was startled! What an unexpected yet interesting turn of events! It was rather clear that the plan has burnt to ashes now. Ahteo was screaming in pain while the bartender started yelling ""HOW DARE YOU SPOIL THE BEST SONG EVER CREATED"" and well, I didn't have much of a choice but to agree with him as in all honesty, Ahteo ruined the song. The bartender calmed down, came over to us, helped Ahteo up. We put him on a chair and wrapped his head with the papers we used for his fake breasts. The bartender apologized for breaking the bottle on his head and wasting all the whiskey. He knew we hated to waste them. Ahteo hugged him and they both had a small funeral for the whiskey that was poured. Following that, we had free flow Guinness all night. We paid only $10 a pint each and I drank for $1000. Well, Ahteo drank about $1000 worth of cider instead because after the stunt he pulled off, he found out he actually liked dressing up as a woman.   We got more for less! Ahteo's head wasn't worth anything since it's empty anyway.",1313,neutral,3/1/2017 0:56,0,3,524,0.404761905,1,17,19,3
3127,Dilys Chok Dee Poh,1.02E+16,"One day when I planned for a motherdaughter outing with Ruby, we decided to have lunch at a particular BBQ/grill place which changes their menu every other day based on whatever's fresh. Fastforward after eating and when we were paying the bill, we were charged with a random 20% discount off our bill. Sure, why not take it right? So out of curiousity, I questioned the cashier on why did we get a discount? She said ""oh because the chef said the lobsters were not as fresh today. So we can't compromise on quality."" We paid less and we got the full grill menu of that day with 20% off, win! #BallinWithGrab #MoreForLess",1325,positive,3/3/2017 5:50,5,5,113,1,0,1,2,1

3130,Sheereen Teo,1.02E+16,"Date nights/day outs in Singapore CAN get pretty expensive and most couples would attest to this. So any opportunity to get more bang for our buck would definitely be utilised.  On one particular ""date day out"", we'd singlehandedly managed to accomplish 3 activities without forking out a single cent (not including public transport!)  1: Watching a weekend movie (courtesy of me winning an internal company award and scoring movie tickets, yeeeeba!)  2: A public exhibition (and a pretty interesting one at that coz it was about defence) and finally,  3: A FREE dinner (the ultimate clincher, please don't stop reading). So after dinner and in our haste to get home to catch the last train (all you last train folks, I'm sure ya feel me ), we hurriedly settled the bill without looking and raced to the station. But I had a niggling feeling there was something weird with the numbers. While we were on the train home, I was looking at the receipt and found out why  the restaurant had undercharged us by accident! >.< My SO then piped up, ""Actually, that dinner was also free coz I paid for it with the $10 we picked up at Sentosa last week""   So number 3 honestly isn't the best highlight (coz I do still feel bad!) but this Date Day Out was truly #MoreForLess.   cc Shawn Goh my fave partnerincrime . now everyone knows how cheap we are! hehehhe #sayitloudsayitproud #pigebuaytahan #cheepcheap  also, #BallinWithGrab !!!",1334,,3/4/2017 6:55,6,6,245,1.105263158,0,4,12,2
