She accidentally told us she was going home and it was her last ride for the day.

The driver also tampered with the records - the mileage was changed to reflect a journey of 3.2 kilometres apparently driven in 01:12:17.   This is a serious criminal offence and this con-artist should be permanently banned from commercial driving.  To make things worse, there is no actual customer service personnel to follow-up over such negative issues. Unlike ComfortDelGro Taxi which has a dedicated manager to call up customers when they face serious issues with their drivers.  Uber only sends affected customers generic computerized messages that do not contain any detail on how the driver is dealt with. In some cases, the driver is still allowed to continue driving despite taking advantage of Uber or its customers.","839304559565383_840171136145392","negative",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

For the discount is great, despite many ppl told me that the fare, the driver, the apps and even the customer service are bad, don ever consider about using uber. I ignore them as I want to give uber a chance and as an alternative to get a ride beside my usual ride from Grab.    I regretted!!! I wrote to uber and was Told that the code is not valid and I asked why there is no decline of the code during booking, no reply from them anymore.    I m writing this post to warn others not to take uber when you are new, the fare is double of grab, I checked grab n uber app this morning, grab only quoted the fare $15, whereas uber quoted $25.  Uber just needed to cheat all for all the one time charge and will forgo all customers for not returning to them.

A google online can easily call out disputes about riders having to pay cancellation fees to the next uber driver, who were mercilessly made to collect your debts for you.  FYI, I am not even made aware of of my outstanding balance until I was in the middle of my ride. I paid to the driver, not wanting to make things difficult for him. Upon clarification, Uber explained that they have given me a $6 credit by mistake, hence the outstanding charges. It was by no means my fault and now the charge is sneakily imposed on me. It took me for than a week to use up the credits, and another month before my next uber ride. You made no effort to take back the credits before I used it nor make any attempts to inform me until a notification which was sent in the middle of my ride. It was too late to make any dispute then.   I don't think I ever feel safe to engage your services again. Driver not showing up and we cancel? Driver cancelling on us? Calling a ride by mistake and then cancelling within 5 seconds? Oh be prepared to fork out $6 cancellation charge.

I only knew about the excess charge of $4.61 after my trip. From the email correspondences from your goodself, you explained that it's because I've changed my route. I will like to re-emphasised that I didn't change my route at all! And you mentioned that it's because your driver actually took a longer route and not taking the suggested routes by Uber. Again, it's no fault of mine. I do not work for Uber and I do not know what's the terms of contract between your goodself and the driver. In your words, if your driver didn't follow the suggested route, why did you impose the additional $4.61 on the rider instead? And how can Uber wrongfully charge me for the additional $4.61 without my consent? Is that the correct business practice that you all should adopt? Do you just charge the rider as you deem fit without obtaining the consent from the rider? In this case, it's absolutely unsafe for us to leave our card details with you as we won't know when we will be charged unnecessarily? Looking back at all the emails you send me, you don't seem to feel that by charging rider without their consent is wrong. All your emails only mentioned you will refund me the balance without acknowledging my query on why you charge me without my consent. You are not a metered taxi. If you set a fare, I agree and you stick to it. That's how it works! It's a contract between yourself and the rider. And if you charge me for the wrong route taken, then in your words, shouldn't I seek compensation from you because your driver took a longer route and that results to my time loss? In your email, you mentioned I have issues with your driver, No! I have no issues with your driver. My ride was otherwise smooth if I wasn't wrongfully charged. So again, do not distort the facts.

We are committed to providing reliable and hassle-free ride experiences (me : if u are committed you wouldn't be giving me this lousy reply and horrible drivers !) and keep track of how often driver-partners cancel trips or ask riders to cancel. (Me: did u really keep track?! If so why still allow this horrible irresponsible driver to drive !) To this end, we regularly warn and take action against driver-partners who have high cancellation rates. (Me: how can u prove to your customers you really warn your irresponsible drivers ?!)  We always conduct a review to our Uber partners using the ratings and feedback given by riders by gathering your fair and honest rankings to spot for trends of experiences, to make sure the drivers are meeting Uber's expectations. That being said, if a driver receives enough low-scoring responses to our survey, and after enough attempts to correct the situation, we often times choose not to partner with the driver anymore.(me : review ? U check ?! I can't even give him a bad review when he cancel on me !)  This is why your feedback is both appreciated and helpful to us, as we seek to partner only with drivers who can provide awesome Uber experiences.  We‚Äôd also like to assure you that with every concern raised to us, improvements are being done to better the rider experience. These changes may not happen overnight, but we are working hard to make sure that riders like you get the best experience each and every time.

Instead in both cases, the allocated way was for the driver to go to the blue circled area first.  And what's up with the yellow shaded area?  Why have to make one big round to go to that address highlighted by that yellow shaded area?  Yes I took the time to do this because I really hope you can improve, the current system is very disadvantaged towards the Punggol West residents because we are always allocated to drop off last even though very clearly, our address is way closer to the expressway than the other address and the driver is coming in from TPE and not KPE.

"449","2017-07-31T17:26:24+0000","Irene Patricia Yee",1.02e+16,"I am lodging a complaint on the unprofessional and threatening behaviour of one of your drivers.   The driver arrived at Ikea pick-up point on the second lane, and barely stopped at the uphill slope. I had two heavy Ikea bags and gestured for him to move forward as cars were coming in and it would be difficult to load the bags into the boot. He did not move his car. I waited for a taxi to go past as it was coming up the slope and the taxi driver had impatiently honked at another driver ahead before I crossed over and loaded the boot.   I got into the car without saying a word. The driver asked if I was happy with the service. I replied, 'Not particularly' (along this line). He then asked me to get out of the car and stated he would not drive me to my destination. I assure you if this sounds absurd and unbelievable, it happened exactly as I have described. The driver's car ought to have a video recording; feel free to verify that what I am relating is the absolute truth.  This driver was most determined at provoking me. I told him I would not do as he pleases. He then said he would drive me to the police station. I told him to do what he needed to do. He then drove around the Ikea drop-off point a number of times before calling the police on his mobile phone.   On the phone with the police, he stated that he was on the second lane because Uber drivers are not supposed to pick up at taxi stands. He then added that I was well aware of this. We had zero exchange on this, so it is perplexing that the driver would know what was in my head. It became apparent the driver had to lie to justify his absurd behaviour.  The driver was most selfish to throw this fracas, especially since he had picked up another Uberpool rider and so he was being most unprofessional and inconveniencing two riders at once. Please check with the the other rider if I had said a word upon entering the car. At no point during this incident did I rant, rave or even raise my voice and hurl verbal abuse. The driver is not the owner of me that he should think he can dictate my feelings, thoughts or actions. It is not as if he had greeted me politely and I had not responded. It is not as if he had graciously helped with my bags and I had been ungrateful. Even so, the driver should not feel at liberty to treat riders with so much disdain and disrespect at his fancy, especially when he is representing the Uber brand.  I called √úber and connected with Christine and John, a supervisor, who stated there was nothing he could do to assist, while waiting for the police to arrive. It is most absurd that the police had to be called in, when I had done absolutely nothing to provoke the driver. Basically, the driver imagines riders who enter a car quietly ought to be treated badly, humiliated, and terrorised.   Threatening a passenger and asking her to get out of the car as a means to humiliate her when she had said absolutely nothing cannot possibly be acceptable behaviour of Uber drivers or be representative of Uber's standard.  Inspector Lau informed me that it was really unsafe for me to continue with this journey. I agreed. I got another ride, not with Uber.  Uber needs to do the right thing here and take heed of my complaint. This was most unacceptable and absurd service in this day and age. I will state the likes of such drivers will only tarnish the Uber brand. Kindly ensure that this matter receives the attention it deserves.

We not even using your child seat. And you contact UBER say we use and you charge us a extra $5. Good earning bro.  Nice Uber. Reply this , Sorry to hear about the trouble, Benella.  As you may know, safety is our number one priority and driver-partners are required to follow all applicable regulations in their city. The Singapore government has advised that all children under 1.35m in height should be in an approved child seat. If your driver complies with child restraint regulations, there is no problem taking children in their vehicle.  Your driver contacted us to let us know that you have used his car seat for your ride. Please note that the car seat falls part of our Uber Car Seat product, an on-demand car seat option; the perfect transportation option for parents on the go. All Uber Car Seat vehicles are installed with the IMMI Go Car Seat that‚Äôs easy to install and safe for kids aged 1 year old and above and weighs between 10 to 25kg. This product incurs a SGD 5 booking fee on top of your UberX fare, which we have added to your trip.  Drivers, however, have no obligation to carry a child seat as they may not always have the appropriate restraints. When requesting trips using Uber, you may want to call or text message the driver before they arrive to ensure they are able to take you and your child. If you have a driver who does not carry the appropriate child seating, you are more than welcome to cancel the trip and will not be charged with cancellation fees.  Please let me know if I can help in any other way. Have a great day ahead!  In the first place the driver didn't even mention that my child needs a car seat when we board his car. So what makes you think that I have to pay when I didn't use this thing? My child was sleeping hand carried by my Husband all the way! Since when did we use the car seat. He can cancel if he doesn't have a car seat and insist we use one. BUT HE DIDNT EVEN MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT THE CAR SEAT  What kind of service is this UBER? Not customer first priority.

Is all about contractual agreements between riders with UG and UG with drivers.  1) Contract between UG and Riders, is for UG to get the right car type to send rider from point A to B, but has UG done enough in rider booking app to ensure riders declare the mix of people taking the car? Since LTA and TP has such requirements, there is no wrong on UG to force riders to declare since is it a electronic service contract and the contract has to cover the drivers providing the service. Drivers has no contact and idea who are the riders before the booking and picking the riders, only UG has the mean to contact rider between themselves, more can be done before UG accepts rider's request and sending to drivers.  2) Contract between UG and drivers, is for drivers to fulfill jobs from UG to send their clients (riders) from point A to B. Right now drivers has zero ideas the mix riders they are picking until pickups, drivers should have the option to cancel the trip if the rider's mix is not as per LTA and TP requirements that cancellation should not impact their rating or incentives.  I am proposing that on rider's app, they have to declare if their rider mix has passenger below 1.35m and toddlers, if riders never declare but has such mix, the electronic service contract is consider null and void that driver's app should have the option to cancel without the fear of affecting their rating or incentives. In such cases, since driver already reached pick location and only to realize that riders falsely declared their rider mix, they can start the trip and end with special option indicating false rider declaration that a fee can be charged on rider for trip made to pick them. This will prevent riders from trying to book another car by falsely declaring rider mix.  Right now UG is making drivers or riders to communicate on LTA/TP requirements that has resulted in sour situations in who to cancel the trip if car cannot take the rider. All these are nonsenses, under the PHV new framework, UG has not done enough on ensuring right service to riders and riders both should be fined to if they insist on boarding a car that resulting in drivers caught breaking rules, else where is driver protection?","820099711485868_838011526361353","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

High chances are it would have been the case. 3) Why are u converting the money deducted from my bank account into uber credits for a cancelled trip? This is absurd, my money is now stuck with u guys forcing me to spend on an uber ride. The money should instead be added back into my bank account. This is equivalent to forcing me to pay for a service I never received. 4) In addition, a currency conversion fee of $0.06 was charged by my bank to me due to your mistake. How are you going to rectify that? 5) I messaged you guys through the app only to get an unsatisfactory response that does not at all address my concerns. Not only that, but the person who replied actually marked the problem as solved when it is not.

In the end, I was being charged $38.54, $14.03 more than my initial fare due to the rerouting. This has also caused me 20 minutes late for my urgent appointment. The driver did not apologize to me, in fact, I still thanks her for the ride. I did not blame the driver for taking a longer route and a longer time to my destination. But I cannot accept that I was being charged extra for the longer route and delay. I was informed via email for the extra charges only after the payment was charged to my credit card.

Driver picked us up at changi airport with another passenger travel to Hougang. We travelled to Bishan and the driver told us he would drop the passenger at Hougang first. I feel like cheated when Uber driver WITHOUT informed us in advance, pick up other passengers in Hougang area üò§.

The fare was BEFORE discount, and the discount was supposed to be applied after the ride. I know this because for so many of the rides I have taken, the discount only got applied AFTER the ride. However, on these 3 particular rides, at the end of the rides, the fare became at least $5 to $6 MORE than the original fare I was initially shown.   I then contacted Uber regarding the fare being bloated after the ride - and guess what?? They adjusted the fare down to the original upfront fare, but CLAIMED that the bloated fare WAS the original fare, and hence, I did not get the discounts from the original upfront fare because that was supposed to be the discounted fare. Does that even make sense?? How can a fare be bloated up instead of getting discounted, at the end of a ride??   Morever, I took screenshots from various other rides I took during the same period, as well as noted ALL my evening rides - ALL these rides only had discount applied AFTER the ride! So, is Uber trying to cheat our money by doing this? Out of 20 rides, all upfront fare is original price, then slip 3 rides in and bloat the fare ""by mistake"" after the ride, then CLAIM that that was in fact, the original fare and the original upfront fare was the discounted fare???

Before (Jan to March), it was last in first out (LIFO) and on Thursday evenings when we received and input the new promotion code sent to us via email, our currently active promotion code (sometimes not fully utilised, eg only used 2/4 eligibility) would cease to work and we'd need to wait till Thursday midnight or Friday 6am to again get to enjoy our new promo code discount. There was also no simultaneous application like now for RIDEMORN and DAYRIDE (only one promotion code can be used at a time). Previously it would be one or the other depending on which we input first. We'd need to exhaust 4 trips (eg. RIDEMORN) with one before the other (DAYRIDE) would kick in.  Then in April, suddenly you got very liberal and changed the rules for Singapore to highest discount applies. We were also allowed to stack different promo code discounts like LiveUp $10 with say a $5 off (nett $15 off on our 10th LiveUp trips. Trips with $0 fares plus promo discounted fares towards the 9 LiveUp trip count. Fares with both the discount value (eg $5 off) were applied first then percentage discount (eg 50%) was applied to the remainder and fare charged; listed as Discount ($5 off) and Promotion (50% off amount). Also we were literally covered for promo code discounts from 12-6am, 6-10am and 10am to 12pm. EVERYONE WAS SUPER HAPPY AND CONTENT. Uber usage was very high.  NOW I HEAR THAT THIS WEEK, without ANY WARNING or NOTICE whatsoever, Uber in Singapore had regressed back to LIFO‚ÅâÔ∏èüò°üò°üò° You've caught many Uber riders off guard. How? You've ""kindly"" given selected riders with 4 x $3 off, 20-50% off (customised) promotion codes. By accepting them, they're no longer eligible for RIDEMORN, DAYRIDE or NIGHTRIDES. They'll need to use their active promo code or exhaust their eligibility. BACK TO THE STONE AGES again‚ÄºÔ∏èüò°üò°üò° What the heck are you trying to do? Screw with your loyal riders in such a cruel and unscrupulous manner‚ÅâÔ∏èü§î Why mess with a good thing that was working fine to everyone's satisfaction‚ÅâÔ∏èü§îüò°üò°üò°  This week, I've received a large number of complaints from my almost 9,500 FB members (https://www.facebook.com/groups/1013566295436747/) with angry complaints about usage and application of promo code discounts; along with improper LiveUp trip counter (not moving and should be entitled to their $10 off but denied due to insufficient trip count or ""can't be combined with other promos."")  Things are seriously getting screwed up on your end when you're giving your customers surprises and conflicting replies. Please get all your foreign call centres' CSOs on the same page and give us all correct and consistent replies and the same and proper treatment. Their training and replies reflects very badly on Uber as a very disorganised company where ""the left hand doesn't talk to the right hand."" Total confusion and disharmony‚ÄºÔ∏è  Oh yes, with 9,500 members, IT IS VERY EASY to compare all your CSOs inconsistent and wrong replies. Get your act together please and ensure all your call centres are reading from the same rule book, ACTUALLY READ our message PROPERLY and THOROUGHLY, before just sending a ""canned reply"" that isn't even relevant to the issue/query.  Last, please read through your own online published LiveUp T&C (https://help.uber.com/h/afddb3fd-5907-4609-b9e7-43b6aa1aaa54) and SHOW US in A FB POST where it's says $0 trips aren't a trip as in ""take 9 trips) and when trips aren't counted due to use with promotion code discounts.

He eventually came to the pick up point where we boarded the car. He was smelling of beer. What happened next was even more shocking. He shouted at my mother because we had failed to flag his car when he drove past the pick up point. My brother then told him that there wasn't a need to raise his voice. Instead of calming down and being professional, he shouted even louder and told us to ""get the **** out of my (his) car."" I was shocked at his behaviour. My brother told him that we will be making a report and he kept on verbally abusing my brother with profanities. We alighted and closed the doors. The driver then wound the windows down before further abusing my brother with Hokkien swear words. He had even charged us for the ride.

Since the FIVEOFF3 is the last code that was entered it will first apply on your trips and once the promotion has been fully consumed, the other promotion will apply as long as its still active. Feel free to reach out if you have further questions.""  Uber, this is your reply which I don't think the way you program the line up of your promo codes makes sense especially when my SCB $10 off for next 15 trips promotion is going to expire soon. By the way, this was never like that for the past weeks. I can select which promo to use as they are tagged to individual cards. Meaning to say if I select my SCB to make payment, the $10 off promo code will be used and I appreciate this more than your new method. Bring the old method back please. This new method is like penalising me for adding new promo code and letting my previous promo code lapse whereby it was meant to be a benefit from the bank.","788802627948910_789242581238248","negative",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For background, when using Uber promotional codes, the upfront fare reflected on my Uber application has always been without the promotion value applied. On my latest trip applying the SAVEFIVE code, I only realised after seeing the receipt that the upfront fare had already incorporated the discount after applying promotional code (i.e. I paid $5 more than I expected).  I wrote in to Uber support to check on this issue, and had I been told that the upfront fare will always reflect the fare after incorporating the promotional value, that would be the end of the story. Instead, the response given was that sometimes the upfront fare incorporates the promotional value, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, but don‚Äôt worry because the correct fare will be reflected in your receipt (see screenshot). This suspenseful game of Uber promotional code roulette speaks of a lack of transparency on fares and a principled approach on how promotional fares are reflected in the upfront fare. It‚Äôs like going to a restaurant which offering a promotional discount, but not knowing whether the discount applies until after you‚Äôve been presented with the bill. All Uber riders, please note for your future trips.  To add salt to an already gaping wound, the driver‚Äôs driving was erratic and hazardous (straddling between two lanes for more than a few seconds and coming without centimeters of hitting another car) and due to the questionable UberPool pairing algorithm, my journey (which would have taken 25 minutes by public transport and 6 times cheaper) took a grand total of 40 minutes. Had I known that I was paying a premium for inconvenience, dangerous driving and a longer journey, I might have considered keeping my money in my pocket for this trip.","785103378318835_785800111582495","",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

The ride went smoothly until suddenly, the mother asked the driver if she could change their destination upon almost reaching their initial destination.  I was initially shocked and surprised! Even though the driver told her that it's unfair for himself and I due to inconvenience, she still insisted that she wants their destination to be changed to the latest one üòÇ After much quarrel, the mother and the daughter left no choice but to leave the car and alight at their initial destination.

Changing destination will bring inconvenience to fellow passengers and is irresponsible, even to the driver as well!  Also, changing the route halfway opens a can of worms. There will be problems such as calculation for price and route adjustments especially if there are other users sharing the ride.   I would suggest riders who are unsure of their destination to think twice before using uberPOOL, and to instead consider under professional services from UBER such as UberX. This way we can create a better UBER community and have a better UBER experience :)","782242375271602_782442718584901","",1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The driver had confirmed that he received the original destination I keyed in, so I knew I got it right.

(3) my receipt was later amended, and I was charged an additional $14. In total, I was charged $17.74 for a Uberpool ride from Jurong West to National Dental Centre.   (4) I was grossly overcharged. And heavily penalised for my honesty.   (5) I am extremely upset by the way things are handled.

Before I keyed in a $5 PROMO code, I was shown an upfront fare of $12.96. After keying in, the fare remained as $12.96. Naturally I thought that the deduction will be made in the final fare review. This is the consistent practice with other PROMOs I have taken in my previous trips. This is also written in your FAQ website, https://help.uber.com/h/d2d43bbc-f4bb-4882-b8bb-4bd8acf03a9d , to quote ""This upfront fare does not include promotions or credits.""  Yet, this was not the case, given that the final fare turned out to be $12.96. The receipt miraculously showed that a discount was already applied, hence the initial fare before discount was $17.96.   I have emailed your customer service and they offered me another explanation, saying that different promotions have different T&C.

One time I got a pool ride with 2 other people, all of us were strangers and going to 3 different places.   Next, got an Uber ride where I got into the car, picked up another person, dropped off the other person then went to picked up another person before dropping me off. Best part is, had to wait for both other passengers as they were late. 2 min rule is bs, maybe wait 5 min can still close one eye but waiting over 15 min in total not to mention detours?? That was a nightmare.   Last one that took the cake, detour to pick up another passenger, the other one cancel, took another detour (to back where I was in the first place) to pick up another passenger.   Uber, please don't sacrifice your quality for the sake of more profits. Initially I preferred Uber pool as it had a better algorithm and didn't send me very much out of the way, maybe 5-10 min max added to my ride as it was usually only one other destination, now it's 20+min??

It was absolutely amazing - Armin played a full 3 hour set on day 2, with all his hits. Even now - I'm still craving to enter a state of trance with Armin yet again.  However, what stands out to me the most about that live set that day was when he got the whole crowd to be silent. To say their prayers, and to let the victims and their families know that we are with them. The crowd was completely silent for that few minutes, and I will never forget the goosebumps I had during that moment. How amazing and rare it is for 35,000 ravers to stay silent - to come together as one big family and pray for MH370.  I would love to bring Frances Winata, who unfortunately never had the chance to meet Armin before, to attend this festival with me.

We still reminisce about the forest party every now and then because we don't really get a chance to party in the woods in Singapore.

The drivers are mostly Chinese Nationals and they lack the knowledge of English Language. They even lack navigation skills like as if it's their first time driving to that area but I don't take that as an excuse when it comes to UBER rides like this. I mean, is this how UBER hire the drivers here? There is even one driver that is so complacent and rude and made me late to watch a theatre show at Bugis because he didn't even know where he's going and took a long time to pick up the other rider at Sports Hub during the ride. He doesn't even know how to use the app right. So far this week, I had the worst service ever from UBER.  Well done, UBER. Even when I complaint about the trips through the app, the replies I get are so generic and robotic that it's like as if they don't have feelings for their customers. And they can't even compensate for the terrible rides I had this weekend. I hate UBER!","743554262473747_744249909070849","",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

If already after the $5 discount, then the charge is very expensive (which means original fare is $12.47) and more so than taxi.

I tried several times to book an Uber this morning and I got the message ""Request Failed"" repeatedly. So, I booked a Grab. A few minutes later, a Grab Car AND Uber showed up. I got into the Grab Car (since my Uber app was still on the booking page, NO driver/match indicated) and the Uber driver started horning at me.... The Grab Car stopped and she starting shouting from her car about how I booked an Uber, so I showed her my app page to prove that it didn't indicate a match and yet she still went on and on about how she can't cancel since it affects her ratings. Even my Grab driver had to jump in and try to calm her down by explaining it's an issue with the app. Eventually, we just drove off. This is the SECOND time this week that I've seen this. The first time, it happened to my fellow passenger in an Uber Pool and our driver raised his voice at him while the passenger was trying to explain the situation calmly (he was late to the pick up point because Uber didn't even notify him that he had a car coming). If there's an issue with THE APP, please inform the drivers beforehand that this issue is ongoing so that passengers don't have to bear the brunt of angry Uber drivers when we're clearly not the ones at fault.","738596486302858_739107796251727","",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
"3256","2017-03-06T02:06:46+0000","Mervyn Jui Meng Tan",1.14e+15,"So, taxi companies want to change to dynamic pricing for app bookings to compete head to head with Uber and Grab eh? It's still unclear if they'll only do it during their non peak (no surcharge applied) periods or 24/7? However it seems for street hails and taxi queues, the taxis will use metered fares. If they follow UG's booking fixed fare models, they could start off with GrabCar Economy and UberX like fixed fare trip bookings. If ambitious, they can even progress to a GrabShare and UberPool fixed trip option.  They could also offer promo codes to gain market share from Uber Ang Grab, kicking off another free for all promo code war. ComfortDelGro recently have already been announcing promo codes regularly and with their deep pockets. Combined with Premier and TransCab, this formidable taxi alliance or cartel combined could possibly outlast both Uber and Grab in a no holds bar price/promo code war. Uber and Grab have already slowed down their promo codes to a crawl and dripping trickle. Can Uber and Grab survive the onslaught of the combined taxi alliance/cartel? They may be even forced to form an unlikely and unholy alliance to fend off the competition from the new taxi juggernaut and be completely steamrolled!  Worst is taxis will have the best competitive advantage or ace in the whole of all. Taxis will be able to pickup adults with children under 1.35m as they have a LTA exemption. Good news for Uber and Grab drivers' headaches with those class of riders, plus these class of riders themselves not having to fear being rejected.  But the added competition for normal rides will become more fierce given the sheer size of the combined ComfortDelGro, Premier and TransCab (for now with HDT and SMRT waiting in the wings). Will Uber and Grab be able to handle the onslaught of the new monolith?  Drivers may defect on masse together with fare sensitive riders who have no brand loyalty. It could be an unexpected windfall for both as well as the taxi alliance with their many empty taxis gathering dust in their parking lot. The only barrier for drivers will be the taxi vocational driving license (TDVL). They were all set to take the PDVL (private) but may rethink TVDL now and need longer to obtain it than a PDVL. Existing taxi drivers who jumped ship to Uber or Grab will be able to transition back more easily. Those taxi drivers who were considering a move would probably stay out for now and have a wait and see perspective.  One thing is for sure. More likely than not it will be the rider who will once again be ""king"" and in the cat bird seat!   Time will tell who drivers will ultimately gravitate to. It's time for Uber and Grab to soon reassess many things like revising their partners' compensation, incentives, possibly personal welfare too like offering medical benefits for a start. They'll need to also reexamine their rider retention with lower fares and capped surges like in the Philippines, a new promo code strategy and ways to add value.   Grab has the obvious edge having diversified into so many other ventures. But how much it'll add to their bottom line, no one knows. Clearly it's up to Uber now to do more planning and strategising as they're clearly at the most disadvantage. Hopefully they will finally be forced to offer a customer service phone hotline, something they've long resisted and riders have been clamouring for.  It is going to be an extremely interesting couple of months to come. With the impending regulatory changes to PHV drivers and companies on top of the looming new form of fare competition, riders will be licking their lips with anticipation of being spoilt for choice and lower fares overall.

No longer do we have to wait for silly taxis disappearing in the city centre and unlike grab uber is 99.9999% chance can get a vehicle because drivers cannot see the destination and pick and choose fares. And unlike grab the customer support team based in philipines and or india answer app help or emails typically within minutes. Those who whine over promo codes or higher fares because of routes, cut the company some slack. Try to get to grab support, they will reply after two weeks with a template reply and solves nothing. Need more evidence? Read this http://www.uberpeople.net/threads/reasons-why-grab-is-unsatisfactory.136695/  Grab is indeed using caveman technology. So before complaining about uber would you prefer a life of comfort taxis 3 dollars city surcharges and a midnight surchage? If not think before shooting off yr mouth. Disclaimer: i am just a damn satisfied customer of uber and in no way related to them. Thanks.  Oh and to those who complain about 6 dollar cancellation charges there is a method of getting a confirmed full refund of 6 dollars in credit in yr uber account. Pls read up more and stop harrassing the in app help to get back the 6 dollars when it is automatically refunded if you know what to do.","721106791385161_722046344624539","",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

For 5 measly dollars.   When I went to their Facebook page to leave upset messages (as email and messenger channels were not working out) I realized there were many others like me. It looks to me that there might be a real problem at Uber that they are denying and passing onto the customers.    In short, if you do take Uber, PLEASE CHECK YOUR BILL!  If something goes wrong, it is near impossible to reach them. GRAB at least has a phone line.  As for me, I dare not continue to use them, even if they are cheaper.

When I was in the ride, I checked and saw that Uber had charged me $16!  I've tried all week to get this rectified but their customer service is possibly handled by a center in India and it accepts no phone calls. In the meantime, I've being going to and fro via messages and emails only to receive contradictory stock replies from no less than 5 different people. It's been a huge waste of my time. For 5 measly dollars.   When I went to their Facebook page to leave upset messages (as email and messenger channels were not working out) I realized there were many others like me. It looks to me that there might be a real problem at Uber that they are denying and passing onto the customers.    In short, if you do take Uber, PLEASE CHECK YOUR BILL!  If something goes wrong, it is near impossible to reach them. GRAB at least has a phone line.  As for me, I dare not continue to use them, even if they are cheaper. I don't want to get billed for wrongly calculated charges. I need a trustworthy and reliable company that is contactable and accountable.

I opted for Uber Pool because it was $11 compared to $16 for UberX. When I checked in the ride, I was shocked that I was being charged $16.  I've looked through the comments on this page and I see that many many others have reported being overcharged. Instead of denying you have a problem, why don't you admit it and fix it?!  I contacted customer service at least 5 times only to receive stock replies from their India CS center. I've been told to message them here, but I've done so 3xn and NO ONE has contacted me.  This is what they replied me when I said they had quoted me a lower price and charged me a higher price.    ""The price you see in the app when you enter your pickup and drop off addresses is the rate that you'll be charged for the trip, whether you are matched with a co-rider or taking the trip solo.nThis is the case even if surge pricing is in effect. We aim for complete transparency. We'll always let you know the price you're guaranteed to pay before you place your ride request. I've reviewed your trip details and the conversation. In your trip, you were charged the upfront fare which was shown at the beginning of your trip. So that the trip fare wasn't adjusted.""  And this total contradiction :   ""If you're seeing a different fare for a trip that you took previously, it's due to this dynamic pricing algorithm that changes along with the market.""  So what is it? You told me the fare doesn't change. But that you may adjust dynamically?  I've checked the rates for the same exact trip that I took and the rates for UberPool never hit $16 at off peak.  This is a telling sign that there was indeed a glitch. It is unethical to continue denying this and passing on your problems to the customer.  If customers cannot trust that you will not charge indiscriminately, how can they trust using Uber?","717227601773080_717288491766991","",1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is UBERS reply when you say that you have been overcharged:   ""The price you see in the app when you enter your pickup and drop off addresses is the rate that you'll be charged for the trip, whether you are matched with a co-rider or taking the trip solo.""  ""This is the case even if surge pricing is in effect. We aim for complete transparency. We'll always let you know the price you're guaranteed to pay before you place your ride request.""  ""I've reviewed your trip details and the conversation. In your trip, you were charged the upfront fare which was shown at the beginning of your trip. So that the trip fare wasn't adjusted.""  -------------  However, this also what Uber has replied me regarding the SAME over charging issue:  ""If you're seeing a different fare for a trip that you took previously, it's due to this dynamic pricing algorithm that changes along with the market.""  TOTAL CONTRADICTION!  2. This is UBER's reply when you ask to speak to a customer service staff -   I understand that you would like to speak on the phone about this concern. Though we don‚Äôt currently provide phone support for these issues right now, I‚Äôll be happy to work with you via email to fully resolve your issue as quickly as possible. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or concerns. We're here to help.  RESOLVED ------------  The irony is, my dispute was just $5.

This had happened to me one other time when I took UberX. When I wrote in, they said the fare was adjusted because the driver took another route.  When I wrote in to explain what happened today, I was told that the price I accept on the App does not change and that I had been quoted 16. TOTAL CONTRADICTION.

On 18th January 2017,1.53 am,  i book a Uber XL to fetch me and other friends to Park Royal Kitchener road from Orchard Plaza.  While waiting, i saw the driver(Dilly) was driving towards my location, after which i saw that the GPS put the driver was directly opp of my direction which is on Karamat Lane, BUT i didn't see any Toyota Wish that the driver was driving neither the GPS spot is not moving at all.  I called him few times, Dilly answered but no voice came from the other side and he cancelled on me with no valid reason.  I have a bad feeling that he did it not to fetch me and my friends in order to claim cancellation of $6 easily and to cheat customer's money just like that.  May i request your team to investigate this problem out.  Thanks alot.  I had send in email as well, cause this is not acceptable to cancel ppl's ride after 5 mins just to claim the $6.","713633118799195_713724455456728","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

Not one time have I had a smooth trip the last week.   First - I was charged two times cancellation fees for two trips that I did not cancel on 13 Jan. The first cancellation fee refund was successfully credited into my account as 'Uber credits'. Which Uber then used to DEDUCT for a SECOND UBER i booked which i DID NOT CANCEL. Hence, I did not even get to use the supposed 'Uber credits' that you deposited. After all the time wasted, I finally managed to get a THIRD UBER who thankfully brought me to my meeting (though late). However, the Promo Code was NOT APPLIED to this third ride and I had to spend another round of emails resolving the issue - but the promo code was eventually applied after.   Second experience - On Jan 15 I was already waiting at the indicated pickup location for the Uber. Called the driver three times - no response all three times. after 3 mins of supposed 'arrival' - the driver cancelled and I was supposed to pay the cancellation fee again? As the option chosen this time was ""Cash"" - no amount was deducted from my credit card. However, this issue was reported to Uber and I was told by customer service that they would resolve this.   However, today, when I selected the cash option - I was told that I had to pay an ""outstanding balance"" which was the cancellation fee from the Jan 15 trip - on top of the cost of the actual ride. This is freaking ridiculous - after all the time and effort spent on correcting and resolving the issues, I have to pay an upfront free for rides I have never cancelled, on top of my current ride???  Constant bad service and negative experience for a whole week - how do you expect to retain your customer base?","713633118799195_713674872128353","",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

I have absolutely NO IDEA why this trip is being reflected in my account. At 9.03am, Maurice (+865 9689 9620) messaged me to say that he is at 77 Hollywood Road. I said please proceed to 29 Hollywood road, I am alr day waiting there and can hop on. After waiting in the cold weather for 10minutes, he still didn't arrive. I messaged him to ask him where is he. He said he is coming. However in my Uber map it had showed that he had already circled around the LAN Kwai Fong area twice during the 10minutes, and he was on Wellington Road when he said he is coming. I have a screenshot of our exchanged messages on iMessage. This will PROVE that my trip is supposed to start from 29 HOLLY WOOD ROAD AND NOT 20-20B QUEEN'S ROAD!!!!!

As it's ""partner"", I picked up a rider from Breadtalk IHQ at Tai Seng on an UberPOOL trip and sent him all the way home at Punggol, and surprisingly, all I received for fare was $1.41 for a 9km ride, lasting 15mins.   Note: It WASN'T the rider's fault. I did not go on the wrong route, and he DID NOT dispute the fare. It's UBER's superb DYNAMIC fare calculation method.   And upon repeatedly requesting for help via the in-app help button, I finally got a reply from a kind Uber staff named Haydz:   ""Thank you for writing in, Valerie.  The fare applied to the trip was the upfront fare. Upfront fares are calculated using the expected time and distance of the trip and local traffic, as well as how many riders and nearby drivers are using Uber at that moment. When fares go up due to increased demand, instead of surge lightning bolts and pop-up screens, riders are given the actual fare before they request their ride.  There‚Äôs no complicated math and no surprises. We estimate the upfront price by considering a variety of factors that typically affect a fare, including surge, traffic, and ERP toll charges. We‚Äôre able to use past data to estimate the likely cost of the trip, and can present that price to a rider before they request.   Let me know if we can help you with anything else.""  Thank you Uber, you have helped me made up my mind to return the vehicle to LCR and never to drive for Uber again. Hope fellow Uber ""partner"" wannabe will take this case into consideration before joining them without doing extensive research.   I'm a part-time student and a part-time Uber ""partner"" and now I feel working part-time for Mcdonald's Singapore is so much better.  P.S. Uber, please don't reply and ask me to report this trip via the in-app help button. I have did that so many times for this trip and that's the reply I finally received.

I first received a call from a uber driver at 6+am this morning on an enquiry about UberFlex and his payment issues. First thoughts were that it might be a scam so I hung up the phone. Soon after within the next hour I had almost 30 uber drivers contacting me. To my utmost surprise, you guys had put my contact number as the point of contact!   Would appreciate if you don't let your ineffectiveness inconvenience the entire pool of uber drivers AND user in future. Didn't know you guys had so much reimbursement issues btw!   Sincerely, An uber commuter turned grab commuter now  *original advertisement of uberflex with MY number as contact point - sent to me by a driver*  Received the sms below UberFLEX Club: Hi, [driver name], your $10 min fare guarantee top up of $39.1 for the week of Dec 12 - Dec 18 will be paid next week, we apologize for the inconvenience caused.
