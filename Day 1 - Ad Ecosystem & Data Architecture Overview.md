# Ad Ecosystem & Data Architecture Overview 

*Trainer: Vivek. Tuesday, 4 July 2017.*

### Why is analytics important?

How do I know which market to be investing in to grab customers' attention? 

* Mobile
* TV
* Social media

How can we connect interesting data points together?

* For every 2 degrees temperature goes up, check-ins at ice-cream shops go up by 2%
* Data: FourSquare + Weather
* If we didn't have the field of analytics, we wouldn't be finding cool shit like this.

### Challenges of Measurement

1. Volume
	* Of which 75% are created by consumers
	* Majority of which are **unstructured**
	* How can we keep pace with *storing* and *using* this?
2. Speed 
	* Exponential growth of social media output
	* 500 hrs of video uploaded to Youtube every minute
	* 1.7M pics liked on instagram
	* 300K tweets sent
* Growth
	* *How can we act faster on this data before it gets outdated, and how can we plan for this?*

### Customer Decision Journey

> Awareness > Familiarity > Consideration > Purchase > LOYALTY

*Proctor & Gamble's 'Moment of Truth' Model (2005)* suggests that:

* Brands are in control
* Amplifying a message will push customers down a linear path to purchase
* 1st moment of truth is where brands should spend most of their marketing money

Now:

> Consider > Evaluate > [Buy, experience, advocate, bond]

*McKinsey's Customer Journey (2015)* 

* **Experience** is what determines future stages of sales.
* Customer is in control; evaluation is constant
* Progress is cyclical rather than linear; brands should invest in stages beyond 1st contact

### Digital Marketing Categorised

* _Paid Media_ - ADVERTISING: pay per click, display and video ads, paid influencers, paid content promo bump
* _Earned Media_ - SHARING: mension,s reposts, reviews. Can be both positive and negative
* _Rented Media_ - ENGAGE: Social pages, blogs, YT channels
* _Owned Properties_ - WEB PROPERTIES: website, mobile site, app

How do you strike a balance with all 4? How can you make a comprehensive marketing strategy out of all these 4 media? Where do I spend my marketing budget? 

# KPI Frameworks

To group key milestones together. This makes it easier to *prioritise effort* and *see value easily*. Also allows you to *see the impact of one KPI on another*, because ALL are related.

### Metrics VS KPIs

Metrics are numbers. Visit to website. One filled form. One purchase. One like. 

KPIs are used to measure critical areas of business performance that hold strategic value. Has direct impact on bottomline performance of company. KPIs qualify a business objective into numbers. 

Metrics are part of KPIs and CAN be KPIs themselves, but KPIs cannot be metrics.

| KPI | Metrics | 
| --- | --- |
| Increase sales | Number of sales transactions must increase by 20% in next 2 quarters |

> *A company only has to focus on improving 1-2% of those METRICS to drive meaningful impact.* 

### Making KPIs Relevant

1. Aligned with business strategy
* Reflect company standards and definitions
* Relatable and empowering for all colleauges
	* Inclusive for all departments
	* Brings everyone together on mission
* Measured using valid data sources - eg. data from GA, Adwords
* Enable customization of your analytics setup
	* Complete video views VS page clicks only
	* Scroll rate through a blog post VS page clicks only
	* Click-through rate VS pure likes
* Timely evaluation, leading to positive action
	* Quote timelines
	* Justify with why its relevant
	* Be explicit about impact it has on business

### What to measure

* Specific View, not generic 40K foot view
* Should be strategic (long-term) instead of tactical (short-term)
* Measure the *process* of the funnel - *where* along the way has trouble happened? 
* Not just important to acquire customers/page views - you need to make sure it RELATES to some part of your customer behavior

### 3 Pillars of Successful Metrics

1. Acquisition
2. Behavior
3. Outcomes

**Acquisition**

* How do you plan to drive traffic to your site?
* How are you prioritising your budget and your time?
* Which forms of social media are working? Not working?

**Behavior**

* What do you expect should ideally happen after they land on yoru website?
* What content should they engage with? (e.g., sign up for a test drive, make an enquiry)
* How long should they stay on the site?

**Outcome**

* How long do you take to convert? 
	* (Days to convert since first coming to the site)
	* When you know how long a CYCLE is
	* What about number of impressions before conversion? 

*Helps you understand which channel is generating value & which is not!*

#### Micro vs Macro conversions

Half-way steps to a full conversion with customers

* Filling up a form
* Signing up for newsletter

* Checkout page flow, number of page clicks per stage of checkout flow

Retention & Post-purchase

* Number of newsletter subscriptions (intent to return to website)

### 3 Whys Question

If you cannot get an answer in 3 questions, relook your framing of the problem. Cannot have clear KPI framework without clear business objective. What problem are they trying to solve, and what result are they expecting?

*Example: Decrease in revenue*

1. WHY are products not sellling?
	2. Look at device breakdown.
	3. Perhaps desktop sales were constant but mobile fell. 
	4. Solution: change CTA message on Mobile, from gentle why to BUY NOW!!

# Goals

Most people get stuck in early stages because of unfriendly quality of unstructured data. But once you progress past stage 3, a storytelling narrative starts appearing. It gets easier to build and improve the process of collecting data. 

**Finding out which channels perform poorly**

* Visits
* Click-through rates

**Welcome page performance**

* Bounce rates
* Pages per visits

**Revenue**

* Macro = Performance of lead generation page. 
* Improve page value = Optimise pages that lead to conversions.

**Optimising Marketing Budget**

* Know how much it costs to acquire each and every customer type.
* Cost per acquisition helps you decide how best to spend your marketing dollars.

**Leads to Conversion**

* Analyse the abandon rate throughout each step of the e-commerce flow. 
* A/B testing to understand how different micro experiences lead to better conversion.

**Optimise performance beyond your site**

* Look more broadly for social and video channels. Don't look at vanity metrics (likes).
* Focus on conversion and amplification of message. Remember to align this with your main marketing strategy to maximise your marketing dollars.

**Economic Value**

* Focus on users and economic value that each micro outcome creates. You;ll be able to determine the metrics that truly create wins. 

**Profitability**

* Should cover both online and offline activity.
* Ensure you are covering business end to end. Meaning, even if online budget is justified, don't ignore your offline spending. 

**Customer Lifetime Value**

* Not easy to get, but try to collect all the customers different activities through an account to link it up. Also, figure out where customers are coming from, spending on, advocating.
